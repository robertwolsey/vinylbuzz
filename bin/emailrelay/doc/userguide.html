   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_1">What is it?</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:1:What is it? -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay is a simple store-and-forward message transfer agent and proxy
     server. It runs on Unix-like operating systems (including Linux and Mac OS X),
     and on Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
     When used as proxy server the E-MailRelay program (<em class="quote">emailrelay</em>) runs in the
     background and accepts e-mail from local e-mail client programs (Thunderbird,
     Outlook etc.) or from the outside world, using the SMTP protocol. As soon as an
     e-mail message is received it is forwarded on to the next SMTP server for onward
     delivery. This becomes more useful when you add in your own message processing:
     as each message is received it can be passed one of your programs for editing,
     filtering, encrypting etc.
    </p>

    <p>
     When used as a store-and-forward transfer agent E-MailRelay runs in two modes:
     the storage daemon part, and the forwarding agent. The storage daemon
     waits for incoming mail and stores anything it receives in a spool directory.
     As a forwarding agent E-MailRelay pulls messages out of the spool directory
     and passes them on to a remote server -- perhaps your ISP mail server.
    </p>

    <p>
     E-MailRelay can also run as a POP3 server so that e-mail client programs can
     read the spooled messages.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_2">What it's not</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:2:What it's not -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay does not do routing of individual messages; it is not a routing MTA.
     It forwards all e-mail messages to a pre-configured SMTP server, regardless of
     any message addressing or DNS redirects.
    </p>

    <p>
     E-MailRelay is not a delivery agent. Some programs like <em class="quote">fetchmail</em> send
     locally-addressed e-mail to the local SMTP server in order to deliver them to
     local system mailboxes. E-MailRelay will not normally do this.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_3">Why use it?</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:3:Why use it? -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay is a simple tool that does SMTP. For simple tasks it is likely
     to be easier to understand and configure than a more general purpose MTA.
    </p>

    <p>
     The code has few dependencies on third-party libraries or run-time environments
     so it is easy to build and install especially when targeting embedded systems.
    </p>

    <p>
     The single-threaded, event-driven design with non-blocking i/o may provide
     better performance and resource usage than some of the alternatives.
    </p>

    <p>
     E-MailRelay is designed to be policy-free, so that you can implement your own
     policies for message retries, bounces, local mailbox delivery, spam filtering
     etc. through external scripts.
    </p>

    <p>
     Typical applications of E-MailRelay include:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>spam filtering and virus checking incoming mail</li>
     <li>adding digital signatures or legal disclaimers to outgoing mail</li>
     <li>store-and-forward for outgoing mail across an intermittent Internet connection</li>
     <li>adding authentication and encryption where the existing infrastructure does not support it</li>
     <li>taking messages in with SMTP and serving them to local POP clients</li>
     <li>giving multiple POP clients independent copies of incoming e-mail</li>
     <li>SMTP proxying by running the proxy server on the firewall host</li>
    </ul>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_4">Running E-MailRelay</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:4:Running E-MailRelay -->
    <p>
     To use E-MailRelay in store-and-forward mode use the <em class="quote">--as-server</em> option to
     start the storage daemon in the background, and then trigger delivery of spooled
     messages by running with the <em class="quote">--as-client</em> option and the address of the target
     host.
    </p>

    <p>
     For example, to start a storage daemon listening on port 10025 use a command
     like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --port 10025 --spool-dir /tmp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     And then to forward the spooled mail to <em class="quote">smarthost</em> run something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-client smarthost:25 --spool-dir /tmp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     To get behaviour more like a proxy you can add the <em class="quote">--poll</em> option so that
     messages are forwarded continuously rather than on-demand. This example starts a
     store-and-forward server that forwards spooled-up e-mail every hour:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --poll 3600 --forward-to smarthost:25
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     For a proxy server that forwards each message as it is being received, without
     any delay, you can use the <em class="quote">--as-proxy</em> mode:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-proxy smarthost:25
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     If you want to edit or filter e-mail as it passes through the proxy then specify
     your pre-processor program with the <em class="quote">--filter</em> option, something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-proxy smarthost:25 --filter /usr/local/bin/addsig
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     To run E-MailRelay as a POP server without SMTP use <em class="quote">--pop</em> and <em class="quote">--no-smtp</em>:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --pop --no-smtp --log --close-stderr
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     The <em class="quote">emailrelay-submit</em> utility can be used to put messages straight into the
     spool directory so that the POP clients can fetch them.
    </p>

    <p>
     By default E-MailRelay will always reject connections from remote machines. To
     allow connections from anywhere use the <em class="quote">--remote-clients</em> option, but please
     check your firewall settings to make sure this cannot be exploited by spammers.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Windows add <em class="quote">--hidden</em> to suppress message boxes and also add <em class="quote">--no-daemon</em>
     if running as a service.
    </p>

    <p>
     For more information on the command-line options refer to the reference guide
     or run:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --help --verbose</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_5">Configuration</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:5:Configuration -->
    <p>
     The <em class="quote">emailrelay</em> program itself is mostly configured through command-line
     options (such as <em class="quote">--port</em> and <em class="quote">--forward-to</em>), so there is no single
     definitive configuration file.
    </p>

    <p>
     However, in most installations on Unix-like system the E-MailRelay server will
     be started up by the boot-time script called <em class="quote">emailrelay</em> in the <em class="quote">/etc/init.d</em>
     directory, and this script uses the configuration file <em class="quote">/etc/emailrelay.conf</em> to
     define the server command-line. Each entry in the configuration file corresponds
     to an E-MailRelay command-line option, so you can edit this file to add and
     remove server options. Refer to the reference guide for a complete list of
     configuration options.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Windows the installation program creates a startup batch file called
     <em class="quote">emailrelay-start.bat</em> that contains all the server command-line options and
     you can edit this file to tailor the server configuration. You can also set up
     your own shortcuts to the E-MailRelay executable and add and remove command-line
     options using the shortcut properties tab.
    </p>

    <p>
     If you are using authentication then you will have to create the text files
     containing your authentication secrets (account names, passwords and password
     hashes). The <em class="quote">--server-auth</em>, <em class="quote">--client-auth</em> and <em class="quote">--pop-auth</em> command-line
     options are used to point to these files.
    </p>

    <p>
     There is also a graphical configuration program called <em class="quote">emailrelay-gui</em> that
     may be available to help with configuring the system. This is intended to be
     used once at installation time (and it is the basis of the self-extracting
     installer on Windows) but it may also be used to do some simple reconfiguration
     of an alreay-installed system. It takes you through a sequence of configuration
     pages and then on the last page creates or updates the configuration files, ie.
     the authentication secrets file and the configuration file <em class="quote">emailrelay.conf</em>
     or <em class="quote">emailrelay-start.bat</em>.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_6">Logging</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:6:Logging -->
    <p>
     If the <em class="quote">--log</em> option is used then E-MailRelay program issues warnings and error
     messages to the <em class="quote">syslog</em> system on Unix or to the Event Viewer's Application log
     on Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Unix systems you can also redirect the standard error stream to a file,
     although you should note that the <em class="quote">--as-server</em> and <em class="quote">--as-proxy</em> options
     implicitly close the standard error stream soon after startup, so you should
     replace them with their equivalent options without the <em class="quote">--close-stderr</em> part.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Windows you can log to a file by adding the <em class="quote">--log-file</em> option to the
     command-line in the startup batch file. The installation process creates a
     second startup batch file that contains this option, so check for that first.
    </p>

    <p>
     For more verbose logging add the <em class="quote">--verbose</em> option to the command-line.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_7">Preventing open mail relay</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:7:Preventing open mail relay -->
    <p>
     If you are running E-MailRelay as a server with a permanent connection to the
     Internet it is important to prevent open mail relay because this can be
     exploited by spammers and get you into trouble with your ISP. By default open
     mail relaying is not possible because E-MailRelay does not accept IP connections
     from remote clients. However, if you use the <em class="quote">--remote-clients</em> option then you
     need to be more careful.
    </p>

    <p>
     If the only required access to the E-MailRelay server is from a local network
     and not from the Internet then just set up your firewall to block incoming
     connections on ports 25 (SMTP) and 110 (POP) and also use the <em class="quote">--interface</em>
     option on the E-MailRelay command-line so that it only listens for incoming
     connections on the local network.
    </p>

    <p>
     If you do need to accept connections from the Internet then you should require
     all clients to authenticate themselves by using the <em class="quote">--server-auth</em> option on
     the E-MailRelay command-line. If you also want local clients running on your
     internal network to be able to bypass this authentication then you can put those
     trusted IP addresses in the E-MailRelay secrets file with an authentication
     mechanism of <em class="quote">NONE</em>. Refer to the reference guide for more information.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_8">Running as a POP server</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:8:Running as a POP server -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can run as a POP server so that e-mail client programs can retrieve
     messages from the E-MailRelay spool directory directly.
    </p>

    <p>
     To allow POP access to spooled messages use a command-line something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --pop --pop-auth=/etc/emailrelay.auth
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     You will need to create the authentication secrets file (<em class="quote">emailrelay.auth</em> in
     this example) containing usernames and passwords. A simple example would look
     like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>server APOP user1 password1
server APOP user2 password2
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     It can sometimes be useful to serve up the same e-mail messages to multiple POP
     clients. For example, you might use several e-mail clients on your local network
     and you would like to see your mail on all of them equally. The <em class="quote">--pop-by-name</em>
     option is intended to be used in this scenario; each e-mail client sees its own
     copy of the e-mail messages, stored in its own sub-directory of the main spool
     directory. The name of the sub-directory is simply the name that the client uses
     to authenticate with the E-MailRelay server. You just need to create the
     sub-directory for each client and then specify <em class="quote">emailrelay-filter-copy</em>
     as the <em class="quote">--filter</em> program.
    </p>

    <p>
     Refer to the reference guide for more information.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_9">Triggering delivery over dial-up</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:9:Triggering delivery over dial-up -->
    <p>
     If you are using E-MailRelay on Unix to store and forward e-mail over an
     intermittent link to Internet such as dial-up or wireless networking, then you
     might need to set things up so that the network tells E-MailRelay when to start
     forwarding e-mail.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Linux systems you should find that there are special directories where you
     can install your own hook scripts that are called whenever a dial-up or wireless
     network connection is established. For dial-up this might be <em class="quote">/etc/ppp/ip-up.d</em>,
     and for wireless <em class="quote">/etc/network/if-up.d</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
     Just create a two-line script like this in the relevant directory:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/sbin/emailrelay --as-client=myisp.net:smtp
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     and make it executable using <em class="quote">chmod +x</em>.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_10">Notification of failed e-mails</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:10:Notification of failed e-mails -->
    <p>
     If e-mail messages cannot be forwarded by the E-MailRelay system then the
     envelope files in the spool directory are given a <em class="quote">.bad</em> suffix. The reason for
     the failure will be recorded in the envelope file itself.
    </p>

    <p>
     You should check for <em class="quote">.bad</em> envelope files in the E-MailRelay spool directory
     from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
     If you want failed e-mails to be retried a few times you can run the
     <em class="quote">emailrelay-resubmit</em> script periodically. This script simply removes the <em class="quote">.bad</em>
     suffix from files in the spool directory, as long as they have not been retried
     too many times already.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_11">Usage patterns</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:11:Usage patterns -->
    <p>
     The simplest ways of using E-MailRelay for SMTP are as a proxy or for
     store-and-forward, but many other configurations are possible. For example,
     multiple E-MailRelay servers can run in parallel sharing the same spool
     directory, or they can be chained in series to that e-mail messages get
     transferred from one to the next.
    </p>

    <p>
     Remember that messages can be introduced directly into the E-MailRelay spool
     directory using the <em class="quote">emailrelay-submit</em> utility, and they can be moved out again
     at any time, as long as the envelope file is not locked (ie. with a special
     filename extension). Your <em class="quote">--filter</em> program can edit messages in any way you
     want, and it can even remove the current message from the spool directory.
    </p>

    <p>
     When using E-MailRelay as a POP server the <em class="quote">--pop-by-name</em> feature can be used
     to serve up different spooled messages according to the username that the client
     authenticated with: each user's messages are taken from their own sub-directory
     of the main spool directory. If messages are coming in over SMTP then you could
     install an SMTP <em class="quote">--filter</em> script to move each new message into the relevant
     sub-directory based on the message addressing.
    </p>

    <p>
     For more ideas check out the <em class="quote">--client-filter</em> and <em class="quote">--poll</em> options, and don't
     overlook the administration and control interface (<em class="quote">--admin</em>) which you can use
     to receive notification of message arrival or force message forwarding at any
     time.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_12">SpamAssassin</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:12:SpamAssassin -->
    <p>
     The E-MailRelay server can use <a class="a-href" href="http://spamassassin.apache.org">SpamAssassin</a>
     to mark or reject potential spam.
    </p>

    <p>
     To get E-MailRelay to reject spam outright you can just use <em class="quote">spamassassin -e</em> as
     your E-MailRelay <em class="quote">--filter</em> program:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --filter="/usr/bin/spamassassin --exit-code"
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Or on Windows:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-server --filter="c:/Program\ Files/perl/site/bin/spamassassin.bat --exit-code"
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     To get spam messages identified by SpamAssassin but still pass through the
     E-MailRelay system you will have to have a small <em class="quote">--filter</em> script to collect
     the output from the <em class="quote">spamassassin</em> program and write it back into the
     E-MailRelay content file.
    </p>

    <p>
     On Unix your <em class="quote">--filter</em> shell script could look something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>#!/bin/sh
spamassassin "$1" &gt; "$1.tmp"
mv "$1.tmp" "$1"
exit 0
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     On Windows an equivalent batch script would be:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>c:\Program Files\perl\site\bin\spamassassin.bat %1 &gt; %1.tmp
ren %1.tmp %1
exit 0
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Or you could adapt the <em class="quote">emailrelay-runperl.js</em> example script.
    </p>
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_13">Google mail</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:13:Google mail -->
    <p>
     To send mail via Google mail's SMTP gateway you will need to create a client
     secrets file containing your account details and also enable TLS/SSL support in
     E-MailRelay by using the <em class="quote">--client-tls</em> option.
    </p>

    <p>
     The secrets file should contain one line of text something like this:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>login client myname@gmail.com mypassword
</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
    <p>
     Reference this file using <em class="quote">--client-auth</em> on the E-MailRelay command-line and
     also add in the <em class="quote">--client-tls</em> option:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --as-proxy=smtp.gmail.com:587 --client-tls --client-auth=/etc/emailrelay.auth ...</pre>
      </div><!-- div-pre -->
   <h2><a class="a-header" name="SH_1_14">Connection tunnelling</a></h2> <!-- index:2:SH:1:14:Connection tunnelling -->
    <p>
     E-MailRelay can send mail out via a SOCKS v4 proxy, which makes it easy to route
     your mail through an encrypted tunnel using <em class="quote">ssh -N -D</em> or via the Tor
     anonymising network.
    </p>

    <p>
     For example, this will run an E-MailRelay proxy on port 1025 that routes via a
     local tor server on port 9050 to the mail server at example.com:
    </p>

      <div class="div-pre">
       <pre>emailrelay --port 1025 --as-proxy=example.com:25@localhost:9050 --domain=anonymous.org --connection-timeout=300

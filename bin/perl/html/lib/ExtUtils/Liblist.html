<p>ExtUtils::Liblist - determine libraries to use and how to use them</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>  require ExtUtils::Liblist;

  $MM-&gt;ext($potential_libs, $verbose, $need_names);

  # Usually you can get away with:
  ExtUtils::Liblist-&gt;ext($potential_libs, $verbose, $need_names)</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This utility takes a list of libraries in the form <code>-llib1 -llib2 -llib3</code> and returns lines suitable for inclusion in an extension Makefile. Extra library paths may be included with the form <code>-L/another/path</code> this will affect the searches for all subsequent libraries.</p>

<p>It returns an array of four or five scalar values: EXTRALIBS, BSLOADLIBS, LDLOADLIBS, LD_RUN_PATH, and, optionally, a reference to the array of the filenames of actual libraries. Some of these don&#39;t mean anything unless on Unix. See the details about those platform specifics below. The list of the filenames is returned only if $need_names argument is true.</p>

<p>Dependent libraries can be linked in one of three ways:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>For static extensions</p>

<p>by the ld command when the perl binary is linked with the extension library. See EXTRALIBS below.</p>

</li>
<li><p>For dynamic extensions at build/link time</p>

<p>by the ld command when the shared object is built/linked. See LDLOADLIBS below.</p>

</li>
<li><p>For dynamic extensions at load time</p>

<p>by the DynaLoader when the shared object is loaded. See BSLOADLIBS below.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="EXTRALIBS">EXTRALIBS</h2>

<p>List of libraries that need to be linked with when linking a perl binary which includes this extension. Only those libraries that actually exist are included. These are written to a file and used when linking perl.</p>

<h2 id="LDLOADLIBS-and-LD_RUN_PATH">LDLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH</h2>

<p>List of those libraries which can or must be linked into the shared library when created using ld. These may be static or dynamic libraries. LD_RUN_PATH is a colon separated list of the directories in LDLOADLIBS. It is passed as an environment variable to the process that links the shared library.</p>

<h2 id="BSLOADLIBS">BSLOADLIBS</h2>

<p>List of those libraries that are needed but can be linked in dynamically at run time on this platform. SunOS/Solaris does not need this because ld records the information (from LDLOADLIBS) into the object file. This list is used to create a .bs (bootstrap) file.</p>

<h1 id="PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</h1>

<p>This module deals with a lot of system dependencies and has quite a few architecture specific <code>if</code>s in the code.</p>

<h2 id="VMS-implementation">VMS implementation</h2>

<p>The version of ext() which is executed under VMS differs from the Unix-OS/2 version in several respects:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Input library and path specifications are accepted with or without the <code>-l</code> and <code>-L</code> prefixes used by Unix linkers. If neither prefix is present, a token is considered a directory to search if it is in fact a directory, and a library to search for otherwise. Authors who wish their extensions to be portable to Unix or OS/2 should use the Unix prefixes, since the Unix-OS/2 version of ext() requires them.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Wherever possible, shareable images are preferred to object libraries, and object libraries to plain object files. In accordance with VMS naming conventions, ext() looks for files named <i>lib</i>shr and <i>lib</i>rtl; it also looks for <i>lib</i>lib and lib<i>lib</i> to accommodate Unix conventions used in some ported software.</p>

</li>
<li><p>For each library that is found, an appropriate directive for a linker options file is generated. The return values are space-separated strings of these directives, rather than elements used on the linker command line.</p>

</li>
<li><p>LDLOADLIBS contains both the libraries found based on <code>$potential_libs</code> and the CRTLs, if any, specified in Config.pm. EXTRALIBS contains just those libraries found based on <code>$potential_libs</code>. BSLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH are always empty.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, an attempt is made to recognize several common Unix library names, and filter them out or convert them to their VMS equivalents, as appropriate.</p>

<p>In general, the VMS version of ext() should properly handle input from extensions originally designed for a Unix or VMS environment. If you encounter problems, or discover cases where the search could be improved, please let us know.</p>

<h2 id="Win32-implementation">Win32 implementation</h2>

<p>The version of ext() which is executed under Win32 differs from the Unix-OS/2 version in several respects:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If <code>$potential_libs</code> is empty, the return value will be empty. Otherwise, the libraries specified by <code>$Config{perllibs}</code> (see Config.pm) will be appended to the list of <code>$potential_libs</code>. The libraries will be searched for in the directories specified in <code>$potential_libs</code>, <code>$Config{libpth}</code>, and in <code>$Config{installarchlib}/CORE</code>. For each library that is found, a space-separated list of fully qualified library pathnames is generated.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Input library and path specifications are accepted with or without the <code>-l</code> and <code>-L</code> prefixes used by Unix linkers.</p>

<p>An entry of the form <code>-La:\foo</code> specifies the <code>a:\foo</code> directory to look for the libraries that follow.</p>

<p>An entry of the form <code>-lfoo</code> specifies the library <code>foo</code>, which may be spelled differently depending on what kind of compiler you are using. If you are using GCC, it gets translated to <code>libfoo.a</code>, but for other win32 compilers, it becomes <code>foo.lib</code>. If no files are found by those translated names, one more attempt is made to find them using either <code>foo.a</code> or <code>libfoo.lib</code>, depending on whether GCC or some other win32 compiler is being used, respectively.</p>

<p>If neither the <code>-L</code> or <code>-l</code> prefix is present in an entry, the entry is considered a directory to search if it is in fact a directory, and a library to search for otherwise. The <code>$Config{lib_ext}</code> suffix will be appended to any entries that are not directories and don&#39;t already have the suffix.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>-L</code> and <code>-l</code> prefixes are <b>not required</b>, but authors who wish their extensions to be portable to Unix or OS/2 should use the prefixes, since the Unix-OS/2 version of ext() requires them.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Entries cannot be plain object files, as many Win32 compilers will not handle object files in the place of libraries.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Entries in <code>$potential_libs</code> beginning with a colon and followed by alphanumeric characters are treated as flags. Unknown flags will be ignored.</p>

<p>An entry that matches <code>/:nodefault/i</code> disables the appending of default libraries found in <code>$Config{perllibs}</code> (this should be only needed very rarely).</p>

<p>An entry that matches <code>/:nosearch/i</code> disables all searching for the libraries specified after it. Translation of <code>-Lfoo</code> and <code>-lfoo</code> still happens as appropriate (depending on compiler being used, as reflected by <code>$Config{cc}</code>), but the entries are not verified to be valid files or directories.</p>

<p>An entry that matches <code>/:search/i</code> reenables searching for the libraries specified after it. You can put it at the end to enable searching for default libraries specified by <code>$Config{perllibs}</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The libraries specified may be a mixture of static libraries and import libraries (to link with DLLs). Since both kinds are used pretty transparently on the Win32 platform, we do not attempt to distinguish between them.</p>

</li>
<li><p>LDLOADLIBS and EXTRALIBS are always identical under Win32, and BSLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH are always empty (this may change in future).</p>

</li>
<li><p>You must make sure that any paths and path components are properly surrounded with double-quotes if they contain spaces. For example, <code>$potential_libs</code> could be (literally):</p>

<pre><code>        &quot;-Lc:\Program Files\vc\lib&quot; msvcrt.lib &quot;la test\foo bar.lib&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Note how the first and last entries are protected by quotes in order to protect the spaces.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Since this module is most often used only indirectly from extension <code>Makefile.PL</code> files, here is an example <code>Makefile.PL</code> entry to add a library to the build process for an extension:</p>

<pre><code>        LIBS =&gt; [&#39;-lgl&#39;]</code></pre>

<p>When using GCC, that entry specifies that MakeMaker should first look for <code>libgl.a</code> (followed by <code>gl.a</code>) in all the locations specified by <code>$Config{libpth}</code>.</p>

<p>When using a compiler other than GCC, the above entry will search for <code>gl.lib</code> (followed by <code>libgl.lib</code>).</p>

<p>If the library happens to be in a location not in <code>$Config{libpth}</code>, you need:</p>

<pre><code>        LIBS =&gt; [&#39;-Lc:\gllibs -lgl&#39;]</code></pre>

<p>Here is a less often used example:</p>

<pre><code>        LIBS =&gt; [&#39;-lgl&#39;, &#39;:nosearch -Ld:\mesalibs -lmesa -luser32&#39;]</code></pre>

<p>This specifies a search for library <code>gl</code> as before. If that search fails to find the library, it looks at the next item in the list. The <code>:nosearch</code> flag will prevent searching for the libraries that follow, so it simply returns the value as <code>-Ld:\mesalibs -lmesa -luser32</code>, since GCC can use that value as is with its linker.</p>

<p>When using the Visual C compiler, the second item is returned as <code>-libpath:d:\mesalibs mesa.lib user32.lib</code>.</p>

<p>When using the Borland compiler, the second item is returned as <code>-Ld:\mesalibs mesa.lib user32.lib</code>, and MakeMaker takes care of moving the <code>-Ld:\mesalibs</code> to the correct place in the linker command line.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl5300delta - what is new for perl v5.30.0</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.28.0 release and the 5.30.0 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perl5280delta.html">perl5280delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.28.0.</p>

<h1 id="Notice">Notice</h1>

<p>sv_utf8_(downgrade|decode) are no longer marked as experimental. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133788">[perl #133788]</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<h2 id="Limited-variable-length-lookbehind-in-regular-expression-pattern-matching-is-now-experimentally-supported">Limited variable length lookbehind in regular expression pattern matching is now experimentally supported</h2>

<p>Using a lookbehind assertion (like <code>(?&lt;=foo?)</code> or <code>(?&lt;!ba{1,9}r)</code> previously would generate an error and refuse to compile. Now it compiles (if the maximum lookbehind is at most 255 characters), but raises a warning in the new <code>experimental::vlb</code> warnings category. This is to caution you that the precise behavior is subject to change based on feedback from use in the field.</p>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#pattern">&quot;(?&lt;=pattern)&quot; in perlre</a> and <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#pattern">&quot;(?&lt;!pattern)&quot; in perlre</a>.</p>

<h2 id="The-upper-limit-n-specifiable-in-a-regular-expression-quantifier-of-the-form-m-n-has-been-doubled-to-65534">The upper limit <code>&quot;n&quot;</code> specifiable in a regular expression quantifier of the form <code>&quot;{m,n}&quot;</code> has been doubled to 65534</h2>

<p>The meaning of an unbounded upper quantifier <code>&quot;{m,}&quot;</code> remains unchanged. It matches 2**31 - 1 times on most platforms, and more on ones where a C language short variable is more than 4 bytes long.</p>

<h2 id="Unicode-12.1-is-supported">Unicode 12.1 is supported</h2>

<p>Because of a change in Unicode release cycles, Perl jumps from Unicode 10.0 in Perl 5.28 to Unicode 12.1 in Perl 5.30.</p>

<p>For details on the Unicode changes, see <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/">https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/</a> for 11.0; <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/">https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/</a> for 12.0; and <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/">https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.1.0/</a> for 12.1. (Unicode 12.1 differs from 12.0 only in the addition of a single character, that for the new Japanese era name.)</p>

<p>The Word_Break property, as in past Perl releases, remains tailored to behave more in line with expectations of Perl users. This means that sequential runs of horizontal white space characters are not broken apart, but kept as a single run. Unicode 11 changed from past versions to be more in line with Perl, but it left several white space characters as causing breaks: TAB, NO BREAK SPACE, and FIGURE SPACE (U+2007). We have decided to continue to use the previous Perl tailoring with regards to these.</p>

<h2 id="Wildcards-in-Unicode-property-value-specifications-are-now-partially-supported">Wildcards in Unicode property value specifications are now partially supported</h2>

<p>You can now do something like this in a regular expression pattern</p>

<pre><code> qr! \p{nv= /(?x) \A [0-5] \z / }!</code></pre>

<p>which matches all Unicode code points whose numeric value is between 0 and 5 inclusive. So, it could match the Thai or Bengali digits whose numeric values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.</p>

<p>This marks another step in implementing the regular expression features the Unicode Consortium suggests.</p>

<p>Most properties are supported, with the remainder planned for 5.32. Details are in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlunicode.html#Wildcards-in-Property-Values">&quot;Wildcards in Property Values&quot; in perlunicode</a>.</p>

<h2 id="qr-N-name-is-now-supported">qr&#39;\N{name}&#39; is now supported</h2>

<p>Previously it was an error to evaluate a named character <code>\N{...}</code> within a single quoted regular expression pattern (whose evaluation is deferred from the normal place). This restriction is now removed.</p>

<h2 id="Turkic-UTF-8-locales-are-now-seamlessly-supported">Turkic UTF-8 locales are now seamlessly supported</h2>

<p>Turkic languages have different casing rules than other languages for the characters <code>&quot;i&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;I&quot;</code>. The uppercase of <code>&quot;i&quot;</code> is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE (U+0130); and the lowercase of <code>&quot;I&quot;</code> is LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I (U+0131). Unicode furnishes alternate casing rules for use with Turkic languages. Previously, Perl ignored these, but now, it uses them when it detects that it is operating under a Turkic UTF-8 locale.</p>

<h2 id="It-is-now-possible-to-compile-perl-to-always-use-thread-safe-locale-operations">It is now possible to compile perl to always use thread-safe locale operations.</h2>

<p>Previously, these calls were only used when the perl was compiled to be multi-threaded. To always enable them, add</p>

<pre><code> -Accflags=&#39;-DUSE_THREAD_SAFE_LOCALE&#39;</code></pre>

<p>to your <i>Configure</i> flags.</p>

<h2 id="Eliminate-opASSIGN-macro-usage-from-core">Eliminate opASSIGN macro usage from core</h2>

<p>This macro is still defined but no longer used in core</p>

<h2 id="Drv-now-means-something-on--DDEBUGGING-builds"><code>-Drv</code> now means something on <code>-DDEBUGGING</code> builds</h2>

<p>Now, adding the verbose flag (<code>-Dv</code>) to the <code>-Dr</code> flag turns on all possible regular expression debugging.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<h2 id="Assigning-non-zero-to-is-fatal">Assigning non-zero to <code>$[</code> is fatal</h2>

<p>Setting <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlvar.html#pod"><code>$[</code></a> to a non-zero value has been deprecated since Perl 5.12 and now throws a fatal error. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldeprecation.html#Assigning-non-zero-to-is-fatal">&quot;Assigning non-zero to <code>$[</code> is fatal&quot; in perldeprecation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Delimiters-must-now-be-graphemes">Delimiters must now be graphemes</h2>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldeprecation.html#Use-of-unassigned-code-point-or-non-standalone-grapheme-for-a-delimiter">&quot;Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter.&quot; in perldeprecation</a></p>

<h2 id="Some-formerly-deprecated-uses-of-an-unescaped-left-brace-in-regular-expression-patterns-are-now-illegal">Some formerly deprecated uses of an unescaped left brace <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> in regular expression patterns are now illegal</h2>

<p>But to avoid breaking code unnecessarily, most instances that issued a deprecation warning, remain legal and now have a non-deprecation warning raised. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldeprecation.html#Unescaped-left-braces-in-regular-expressions">&quot;Unescaped left braces in regular expressions&quot; in perldeprecation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Previously-deprecated-sysread-syswrite-on-:utf8-handles-is-now-fatal">Previously deprecated sysread()/syswrite() on :utf8 handles is now fatal</h2>

<p>Calling sysread(), syswrite(), send() or recv() on a <code>:utf8</code> handle, whether applied explicitly or implicitly, is now fatal. This was deprecated in perl 5.24.</p>

<p>There were two problems with calling these functions on <code>:utf8</code> handles:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>All four functions only paid attention to the <code>:utf8</code> flag. Other layers were completely ignored, so a handle with <code>:encoding(UTF-16LE)</code> layer would be treated as UTF-8. Other layers, such as compression are completely ignored with or without the <code>:utf8</code> flag.</p>

</li>
<li><p>sysread() and recv() would read from the handle, skipping any validation by the layers, and do no validation of their own. This could lead to invalidly encoded perl scalars.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125760">[perl #125760]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="my-in-false-conditional-prohibited">my() in false conditional prohibited</h2>

<p>Declarations such as <code>my $x if 0</code> are no longer permitted.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133543">[perl #133543]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Fatalize-and">Fatalize $* and $#</h2>

<p>These special variables, long deprecated, now throw exceptions when used.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133583">[perl #133583]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Fatalize-unqualified-use-of-dump">Fatalize unqualified use of dump()</h2>

<p>The <code>dump()</code> function, long discouraged, may no longer be used unless it is fully qualified, <i>i.e.</i>, <code>CORE::dump()</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133584">[perl #133584]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Remove-File::Glob::glob">Remove File::Glob::glob()</h2>

<p>The <code>File::Glob::glob()</code> function, long deprecated, has been removed and now throws an exception which advises use of <code>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</code> instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133586">[perl #133586]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pack-no-longer-can-return-malformed-UTF-8"><code>pack()</code> no longer can return malformed UTF-8</h2>

<p>It croaks if it would otherwise return a UTF-8 string that contains malformed UTF-8. This protects against potential security threats. This is considered a bug fix as well. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131642">[perl #131642]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Any-set-of-digits-in-the-Common-script-are-legal-in-a-script-run-of-another-script">Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script</h2>

<p>There are several sets of digits in the Common script. <code>[0-9]</code> is the most familiar. But there are also <code>[\x{FF10}-\x{FF19}]</code> (FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO - FULLWIDTH DIGIT NINE), and several sets for use in mathematical notation, such as the MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE-STRUCK DIGITs. Any of these sets should be able to appear in script runs of, say, Greek. But the design of 5.30 overlooked all but the ASCII digits <code>[0-9]</code>, so the design was flawed. This has been fixed, so is both a bug fix and an incompatibility. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133547">[perl #133547]</a>.</p>

<p>All digits in a run still have to come from the same set of ten digits.</p>

<h2 id="JSON::PP-enables-allow_nonref-by-default">JSON::PP enables allow_nonref by default</h2>

<p>As JSON::XS 4.0 changed its policy and enabled allow_nonref by default, JSON::PP also enabled allow_nonref by default.</p>

<h1 id="Deprecations">Deprecations</h1>

<h2 id="In-XS-code-use-of-various-macros-dealing-with-UTF-8">In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.</h2>

<p>This deprecation was scheduled to become fatal in 5.30, but has been delayed to 5.32 due to problems that showed up with some CPAN modules. For details of what&#39;s affected, see <a>perldeprecation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Translating from UTF-8 into the code point it represents now is done via a deterministic finite automaton, speeding it up. As a typical example, <code>ord(&quot;\x7fff&quot;)</code> now requires 12% fewer instructions than before. The performance of checking that a sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8 is similarly improved, again by using a DFA.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Eliminate recursion from finalize_op(). <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108276">[perl #108276]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A handful of small optimizations related to character folding and character classes in regular expressions.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Optimization of <code>IV</code> to <code>UV</code> conversions. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133677">[perl #133677]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Speed up of the integer stringification algorithm by processing two digits at a time instead of one. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133691">[perl #133691]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Improvements based on LGTM analysis and recommendation. (<a href="https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Perl/perl5/alerts/?mode=tree">https://lgtm.com/projects/g/Perl/perl5/alerts/?mode=tree</a>). <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133686">[perl #133686]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133699">[perl #133699]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Code optimizations in <i>regcomp.c</i>, <i>regcomp.h</i>, <i>regexec.c</i>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Regular expression pattern matching of things like <code>qr/[^<i>a</i>]/</code> is significantly sped up, where <i>a</i> is any ASCII character. Other classes can get this speed up, but which ones is complicated and depends on the underlying bit patterns of those characters, so differs between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms, but all case pairs, like <code>qr/[Gg]/</code> are included, as is <code>[^01]</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Removed-Modules-and-Pragmata">Removed Modules and Pragmata</h2>

<p>The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN. Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.</p>

<p>The core versions of these modules will now issue <code>&quot;deprecated&quot;</code>-category warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these deprecation warnings, install the modules in question from CPAN.</p>

<p>Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation, not usually on concerns over their design.</p>

<h2 id="Changes-to-Existing-Diagnostics">Changes to Existing Diagnostics</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>As noted under <a href="#Incompatible-Changes">&quot;Incompatible Changes&quot;</a> above, the deprecation warning &quot;Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/&quot; has been changed to the non-deprecation warning &quot;Unescaped left brace in regex is passed through in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/&quot;.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Specifying <code>\o{}</code> without anything between the braces now yields the fatal error message &quot;Empty \o{}&quot;. Previously it was &quot;Number with no digits&quot;. This means the same wording is used for this kind of error as with similar constructs such as <code>\p{}</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Within the scope of the experimental feature <code>use re &#39;strict&#39;</code>, specifying <code>\x{}</code> without anything between the braces now yields the fatal error message &quot;Empty \x{}&quot;. Previously it was &quot;Number with no digits&quot;. This means the same wording is used for this kind of error as with similar constructs such as <code>\p{}</code>. It is legal, though not wise to have an empty <code>\x</code> outside of <code>re &#39;strict&#39;</code>; it silently generates a NUL character.</p>

<p>An obscure problem in <code>pack()</code> when compiling with HP C-ANSI-C has been fixed by disabling optimizations in <i>pp_pack.c</i>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Mac-OS-X">Mac OS X</dt>
<dd>

<p>Perl&#39;s build and testing process on Mac OS X for <code>-Duseshrplib</code> builds is now compatible with Mac OS X System Integrity Protection (SIP).</p>

<p>SIP prevents binaries in <i>/bin</i> (and a few other places) being passed the <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variable. For our purposes this prevents <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> from being passed to the shell, which prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process, so running <code>perl</code> couldn&#39;t find <i>libperl.dylib</i>.</p>

<p>To work around that, the initial build of the <i>perl</i> executable expects to find <i>libperl.dylib</i> in the build directory, and the library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the installed library.</p>

<li><p>The <code>USE_CPLUSPLUS</code> build option which has long been available in <i>win32/Makefile</i> (for <b>nmake</b>) and <i>win32/makefile.mk</i> (for <b>dmake</b>) is now also available in <i>win32/GNUmakefile</i> (for <b>gmake</b>).</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <b>nmake</b> makefile no longer defaults to Visual C++ 6.0 (a very old version which is unlikely to be widely used today). As a result, it is now a requirement to specify the <code>CCTYPE</code> since there is no obvious choice of which modern version to default to instead. Failure to specify <code>CCTYPE</code> will result in an error being output and the build will stop.</p>

<p>(The <b>dmake</b> and <b>gmake</b> makefiles will automatically detect which compiler is being used, so do not require <code>CCTYPE</code> to be set. This feature has not yet been added to the <b>nmake</b> makefile.)</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>sleep()</code> with warnings enabled for a <code>USE_IMP_SYS</code> build no longer warns about the sleep timeout being too large. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133376">[perl #133376]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (containing Visual C++ 14.2) has been added.</p>

<h1 id="Internal-Changes">Internal Changes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>The sizing pass has been eliminated from the regular expression compiler. An extra pass may instead be needed in some cases to count the number of parenthetical capture groups.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new function <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#my_strtod">&quot;<code>my_strtod</code>&quot; in perlapi</a> or its synonym, Strtod(), is now available with the same signature as the libc strtod(). It provides strotod() equivalent behavior on all platforms, using the best available precision, depending on platform capabilities and <i>Configure</i> options, while handling locale-related issues, such as if the radix character should be a dot or comma.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added <code>newSVsv_nomg()</code> to copy a SV without processing get magic on the source. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132964">[perl #132964]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>It is now forbidden to malloc more than <code>PTRDIFF_T_MAX</code> bytes. Much code (including C optimizers) assumes that all data structures will not be larger than this, so this catches such attempts before overflow happens.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Two new regnodes have been introduced <code>EXACT_ONLY8</code>, and <code>EXACTFU_ONLY8</code>. They&#39;re equivalent to <code>EXACT</code> and <code>EXACTFU</code>, except that they contain a code point which requires UTF-8 to represent/match. Hence, if the target string isn&#39;t UTF-8, we know it can&#39;t possibly match, without needing to try.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>print_bytes_for_locale()</code> is now defined if <code>DEBUGGING</code>, Prior, it didn&#39;t get defined unless <code>LC_COLLATE</code> was defined on the platform.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Compilation under <code>-DPERL_MEM_LOG</code> and <code>-DNO_LOCALE</code> have been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl 5.28 introduced an <code>index()</code> optimization when comparing to -1 (or indirectly, e.g. &gt;= 0). When this optimization was triggered inside a <code>when</code> clause it caused a warning (&quot;Argument %s isn&#39;t numeric in smart match&quot;). This has now been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133368">[perl #133368]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>The new in-place editing code no longer leaks directory handles. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133314">[perl #133314]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Warnings produced from constant folding operations on overloaded values no longer produce spurious &quot;Use of uninitialized value&quot; warnings. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132683">[perl #132683]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix for &quot;mutator not seen in (lex = ...) .= ...&quot; <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133441">[perl #133441]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>pack &quot;u&quot;, &quot;invalid uuencoding&quot;</code> now properly NUL terminates the zero-length SV produced. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132655">[perl #132655]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Improve the debugging output for calloc() calls with <code>-Dm</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133439">[perl #133439]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Regexp script runs were failing to permit ASCII digits in some cases. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133547">[perl #133547]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On Unix-like systems supporting a platform-specific technique for determining <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlvar.html#X"><code>$^X</code></a>, Perl failed to fall back to the generic technique when the platform-specific one fails (for example, a Linux system with /proc not mounted). This was a regression in Perl 5.28.0. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133573">[perl #133573]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/SDBM_File.html">SDBM_File</a> is now more robust with corrupt database files. The improvements do not make SDBM files suitable as an interchange format. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132147">[perl #132147]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>binmode($fh);</code> or <code>binmode($fh, &#39;:raw&#39;);</code> now properly removes the <code>:utf8</code> flag from the default <code>:crlf</code> I/O layer on Win32. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133604">[perl #133604]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The experimental reference aliasing feature was misinterpreting array and hash slice assignment as being localised, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>    \(@a[3,5,7]) = \(....);</code></pre>

<p>was being interpreted as:</p>

<pre><code>    local \(@a[3,5,7]) = \(....);</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133538">[perl #133538]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>sort SUBNAME</code> within an <code>eval EXPR</code> when <code>EXPR</code> was UTF-8 upgraded could panic if the <code>SUBNAME</code> was non-ASCII. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=134061">[perl #134061]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Correctly handle realloc() modifying <code>errno</code> on success so that the modification isn&#39;t visible to the perl user, since realloc() is called implicitly by the interpreter. This modification is permitted by the C standard, but has only been observed on FreeBSD 13.0-CURRENT. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133958">[perl #133958]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl now exposes POSIX <code>getcwd</code> as <code>Internals::getcwd()</code> if available. This is intended for use by <code>Cwd.pm</code> during bootstrapping and may be removed or changed without notice. This fixes some bootstrapping issues while building perl in a directory where some ancestor directory isn&#39;t readable. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133951">[perl #133951]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>pack()</code> no longer can return malformed UTF-8. It croaks if it would otherwise return a UTF-8 string that contains malformed UTF-8. This protects against potential security threats. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131642">[perl #131642]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>See <a href="#Any-set-of-digits-in-the-Common-script-are-legal-in-a-script-run-of-another-script">&quot;Any set of digits in the Common script are legal in a script run of another script&quot;</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Regular expression matching no longer leaves stale UTF-8 length magic when updating <code>$^R</code>. This could result in <code>length($^R)</code> returning an incorrect value.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Reduce recursion on ops <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108276">[perl #108276]</a>.</p>

<p>This can prevent stack overflow when processing extremely deep op trees.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Avoid leak in multiconcat with overloading. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133789">[perl #133789]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The handling of user-defined <code>\p{}</code> properties (see <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Character-Properties">&quot;User-Defined Character Properties&quot; in perlunicode</a>) has been rewritten to be in C (instead of Perl). This speeds things up, but in the process several inconsistencies and bug fixes are made.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>A few error messages have minor wording changes. This is essentially because the new way is integrated into the regex error handling mechanism that marks the position in the input at which the error occurred. That was not possible previously. The messages now also contain additional back-trace-like information in case the error occurs deep in nested calls.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A user-defined property is implemented as a perl subroutine with certain highly constrained naming conventions. It was documented previously that the sub would be in the current package if the package was unspecified. This turned out not to be true in all cases, but now it is.</p>

</li>
<li><p>All recursive calls are treated as infinite recursion. Previously they would cause the interpreter to panic. Now, they cause the regex pattern to fail to compile.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Similarly, any other error likely would lead to a panic; now to just the pattern failing to compile.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The old mechanism did not detect illegal ranges in the definition of the property. Now, the range max must not be smaller than the range min. Otherwise, the pattern fails to compile.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The intention was to have each sub called only once during the lifetime of the program, so that a property&#39;s definition is immutable. This was relaxed so that it could be called once for all /i compilations, and potentially a second time for non-/i (the sub is passed a parameter indicating which). However, in practice there were instances when this was broken, and multiple calls were possible. Those have been fixed. Now (besides the /i,non-/i cases) the only way a sub can be called multiple times is if some component of it has not been defined yet. For example, suppose we have sub IsA() whose definition is known at compile time, and it in turn calls isB() whose definition is not yet known. isA() will be called each time a pattern it appears in is compiled. If isA() also calls isC() and that definition is known, isC() will be called just once.</p>

</li>
<li><p>There were some races and very long hangs should one thread be compiling the same property as another simultaneously. These have now been fixed.</p>

</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a failure to match properly.</p>

<p>An EXACTFish regnode has a finite length it can hold for the string being matched. If that length is exceeded, a second node is used for the next segment of the string, for as many regnodes as are needed. Care has to be taken where to break the string, in order to deal multi-character folds in Unicode correctly. If we want to break a string at a place which could potentially be in the middle of a multi-character fold, we back off one (or more) characters, leaving a shorter EXACTFish regnode. This backing off mechanism contained an off-by-one error. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133756">[perl #133756]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A bare <code>eof</code> call with no previous file handle now returns true. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133721">[perl #133721]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation. Like other errors in sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly crashing perl if compilation continued. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=132158">[perl #132158]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and the process exit code (as stored in <code>$?</code>) is zero, perl will now treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file with any output produced.</p>

<p>This allows code like:</p>

<pre><code>  perl -i -ne &#39;print &quot;Foo&quot;; last&#39;</code></pre>

<p>to replace the input file, while code like:</p>

<pre><code>  perl -i -ne &#39;print &quot;Foo&quot;; die&#39;</code></pre>

<p>will not. Partly resolves <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133659">[perl #133659]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A regression in 5.28 caused the following code to fail</p>

<pre><code> close(STDIN); open(CHILD, &quot;|wc -l&quot;)&#39;</code></pre>

<p>because the child&#39;s stdin would be closed on exec. This has now been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed an issue where compiling a regexp containing both compile-time and run-time code blocks could lead to trying to compile something which is invalid syntax.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed build failures with <code>-DNO_LOCALE_NUMERIC</code> and <code>-DNO_LOCALE_COLLATE</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133696">[perl #133696]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Prevent the tests in <i>ext/B/t/strict.t</i> from being skipped. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133713">[perl #133713]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>/di</code> nodes ending or beginning in <i>s</i> are now <code>EXACTF</code>. We do not want two <code>EXACTFU</code> to be joined together during optimization, and to form a <code>ss</code>, <code>sS</code>, <code>Ss</code> or <code>SS</code> sequence; they are the only multi-character sequences which may match differently under <code>/ui</code> and <code>/di</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

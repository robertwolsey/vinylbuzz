<p>perl5220delta - what is new for perl v5.22.0</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.20.0 release and the 5.22.0 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perl5200delta.html">perl5200delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.20.0.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<h2 id="New-bitwise-operators">New bitwise operators</h2>

<p>A new experimental facility has been added that makes the four standard bitwise operators (<code>&amp; | ^ ~</code>) treat their operands consistently as numbers, and introduces four new dotted operators (<code>&amp;. |. ^. ~.</code>) that treat their operands consistently as strings. The same applies to the assignment variants (<code>&amp;= |= ^= &amp;.= |.= ^.=</code>).</p>

<p>To use this, enable the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature and disable the &quot;experimental::bitwise&quot; warnings category. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlop.html#Bitwise-String-Operators">&quot;Bitwise String Operators&quot; in perlop</a> for details. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123466">[perl #123466]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="New-double-diamond-operator">New double-diamond operator</h2>

<p><code>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</code> is like <code>&lt;&gt;</code> but uses three-argument <code>open</code> to open each file in <code>@ARGV</code>. This means that each element of <code>@ARGV</code> will be treated as an actual file name, and <code>&quot;|foo&quot;</code> won&#39;t be treated as a pipe open.</p>

<h2 id="New-b-boundaries-in-regular-expressions">New <code>\b</code> boundaries in regular expressions</h2>

<h3 id="qr-b-gcb"><code>qr/\b{gcb}/</code></h3>

<p><code>gcb</code> stands for Grapheme Cluster Boundary. It is a Unicode property that finds the boundary between sequences of characters that look like a single character to a native speaker of a language. Perl has long had the ability to deal with these through the <code>\X</code> regular escape sequence. Now, there is an alternative way of handling these. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlrebackslash.html#b-b-B-B">&quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash</a> for details.</p>

<h3 id="qr-b-wb"><code>qr/\b{wb}/</code></h3>

<p><code>wb</code> stands for Word Boundary. It is a Unicode property that finds the boundary between words. This is similar to the plain <code>\b</code> (without braces) but is more suitable for natural language processing. It knows, for example, that apostrophes can occur in the middle of words. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlrebackslash.html#b-b-B-B">&quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash</a> for details.</p>

<h3 id="qr-b-sb"><code>qr/\b{sb}/</code></h3>

<p><code>sb</code> stands for Sentence Boundary. It is a Unicode property to aid in parsing natural language sentences. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlrebackslash.html#b-b-B-B">&quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="Non-Capturing-Regular-Expression-Flag">Non-Capturing Regular Expression Flag</h2>

<p>Regular expressions now support a <code>/n</code> flag that disables capturing and filling in <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc inside of groups:</p>

<pre><code>  &quot;hello&quot; =~ /(hi|hello)/n; # $1 is not set</code></pre>

<p>This is equivalent to putting <code>?:</code> at the beginning of every capturing group.</p>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#n">&quot;n&quot; in perlre</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="use-re-strict"><code>use re &#39;strict&#39;</code></h2>

<p>This applies stricter syntax rules to regular expression patterns compiled within its scope. This will hopefully alert you to typos and other unintentional behavior that backwards-compatibility issues prevent us from reporting in normal regular expression compilations. Because the behavior of this is subject to change in future Perl releases as we gain experience, using this pragma will raise a warning of category <code>experimental::re_strict</code>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/re.html#strict-mode">&#39;strict&#39; in re</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Unicode-7.0-with-correction-is-now-supported">Unicode 7.0 (with correction) is now supported</h2>

<p>For details on what is in this release, see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/">http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/</a>. The version of Unicode 7.0 that comes with Perl includes a correction dealing with glyph shaping in Arabic (see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/errata/#current_errata">http://www.unicode.org/errata/#current_errata</a>).</p>

<h2 id="use-locale-can-restrict-which-locale-categories-are-affected"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use locale</code></span> can restrict which locale categories are affected</h2>

<p>It is now possible to pass a parameter to <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use locale</code></span> to specify a subset of locale categories to be locale-aware, with the remaining ones unaffected. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perllocale.html#The-use-locale-pragma">&quot;The &quot;use locale&quot; pragma&quot; in perllocale</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="Perl-now-supports-POSIX-2008-locale-currency-additions">Perl now supports POSIX 2008 locale currency additions</h2>

<p>On platforms that are able to handle POSIX.1-2008, the hash returned by <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perllocale.html#The-localeconv-function"><code>POSIX::localeconv()</code></a> includes the international currency fields added by that version of the POSIX standard. These are <code>int_n_cs_precedes</code>, <code>int_n_sep_by_space</code>, <code>int_n_sign_posn</code>, <code>int_p_cs_precedes</code>, <code>int_p_sep_by_space</code>, and <code>int_p_sign_posn</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Better-heuristics-on-older-platforms-for-determining-locale-UTF-8ness">Better heuristics on older platforms for determining locale UTF-8ness</h2>

<p>On platforms that implement neither the C99 standard nor the POSIX 2001 standard, determining if the current locale is UTF-8 or not depends on heuristics. These are improved in this release.</p>

<h2 id="Aliasing-via-reference">Aliasing via reference</h2>

<p>Variables and subroutines can now be aliased by assigning to a reference:</p>

<pre><code>    \$c = \$d;
    \&amp;x = \&amp;y;</code></pre>

<p>Aliasing can also be accomplished by using a backslash before a <code>foreach</code> iterator variable; this is perhaps the most useful idiom this feature provides:</p>

<pre><code>    foreach \%hash (@array_of_hash_refs) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>This feature is experimental and must be enabled via <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use feature &#39;refaliasing&#39;</code></span>. It will warn unless the <code>experimental::refaliasing</code> warnings category is disabled.</p>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlref.html#Assigning-to-References">&quot;Assigning to References&quot; in perlref</a></p>

<h2 id="prototype-with-no-arguments"><code>prototype</code> with no arguments</h2>

<p><code>prototype()</code> with no arguments now infers <code>$_</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123514">[perl #123514]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="New-:const-subroutine-attribute">New <code>:const</code> subroutine attribute</h2>

<p>The <code>const</code> attribute can be applied to an anonymous subroutine. It causes the new sub to be executed immediately whenever one is created (<i>i.e.</i> when the <code>sub</code> expression is evaluated). Its value is captured and used to create a new constant subroutine that is returned. This feature is experimental. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlsub.html#Constant-Functions">&quot;Constant Functions&quot; in perlsub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fileno-now-works-on-directory-handles"><code>fileno</code> now works on directory handles</h2>

<p>When the relevant support is available in the operating system, the <code>fileno</code> builtin now works on directory handles, yielding the underlying file descriptor in the same way as for filehandles. On operating systems without such support, <code>fileno</code> on a directory handle continues to return the undefined value, as before, but also sets <code>$!</code> to indicate that the operation is not supported.</p>

<p>Currently, this uses either a <code>dd_fd</code> member in the OS <code>DIR</code> structure, or a <code>dirfd(3)</code> function as specified by POSIX.1-2008.</p>

<h2 id="List-form-of-pipe-open-implemented-for-Win32">List form of pipe open implemented for Win32</h2>

<p>The list form of pipe:</p>

<pre><code>  open my $fh, &quot;-|&quot;, &quot;program&quot;, @arguments;</code></pre>

<p>is now implemented on Win32. It has the same limitations as <code>system LIST</code> on Win32, since the Win32 API doesn&#39;t accept program arguments as a list.</p>

<h2 id="Assignment-to-list-repetition">Assignment to list repetition</h2>

<p><code>(...) x ...</code> can now be used within a list that is assigned to, as long as the left-hand side is a valid lvalue. This allows <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>(undef,undef,$foo) = that_function()</code></span> to be written as <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>((undef)x2, $foo) = that_function()</code></span>.</p>

<h2 id="Infinity-and-NaN-not-a-number-handling-improved">Infinity and NaN (not-a-number) handling improved</h2>

<p>Floating point values are able to hold the special values infinity, negative infinity, and NaN (not-a-number). Now we more robustly recognize and propagate the value in computations, and on output normalize them to the strings <code>Inf</code>, <code>-Inf</code>, and <code>NaN</code>.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/POSIX.html">POSIX</a> enhancements.</p>

<h2 id="Floating-point-parsing-has-been-improved">Floating point parsing has been improved</h2>

<p>Parsing and printing of floating point values has been improved.</p>

<p>As a completely new feature, hexadecimal floating point literals (like <code>0x1.23p-4</code>) are now supported, and they can be output with <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>printf &quot;%a&quot;</code></span>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldata.html#Scalar-value-constructors">&quot;Scalar value constructors&quot; in perldata</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="Packing-infinity-or-not-a-number-into-a-character-is-now-fatal">Packing infinity or not-a-number into a character is now fatal</h2>

<p>Before, when trying to pack infinity or not-a-number into a (signed) character, Perl would warn, and assumed you tried to pack <code>0xFF</code>; if you gave it as an argument to <code>chr</code>, <code>U+FFFD</code> was returned.</p>

<p>But now, all such actions (<code>pack</code>, <code>chr</code>, and <code>print &#39;%c&#39;</code>) result in a fatal error.</p>

<h2 id="Experimental-C-Backtrace-API">Experimental C Backtrace API</h2>

<p>Perl now supports (via a C level API) retrieving the C level backtrace (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).</p>

<p>The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with the symbol names (function names), the object names (like &quot;perl&quot;), and if it can, also the source code locations (file:line).</p>

<p>The supported platforms are Linux and OS X (some *BSD might work at least partly, but they have not yet been tested).</p>

<p>The feature needs to be enabled with <code>Configure -Dusecbacktrace</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlhacktips.html#C-backtrace">&quot;C backtrace&quot; in perlhacktips</a> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="Security">Security</h1>

<h2 id="Perl-is-now-compiled-with--fstack-protector-strong-if-available">Perl is now compiled with <code>-fstack-protector-strong</code> if available</h2>

<p>Perl has been compiled with the anti-stack-smashing option <code>-fstack-protector</code> since 5.10.1. Now Perl uses the newer variant called <code>-fstack-protector-strong</code>, if available.</p>

<h2 id="The-Safe-module-could-allow-outside-packages-to-be-replaced">The <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/Safe.html">Safe</a> module could allow outside packages to be replaced</h2>

<p>Critical bugfix: outside packages could be replaced. <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/Safe.html">Safe</a> has been patched to 2.38 to address this.</p>

<h2 id="Perl-is-now-always-compiled-with--D_FORTIFY_SOURCE-2-if-available">Perl is now always compiled with <code>-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2</code> if available</h2>

<p>The &#39;code hardening&#39; option called <code>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</code>, available in gcc 4.*, is now always used for compiling Perl, if available.</p>

<p>Note that this isn&#39;t necessarily a huge step since in many platforms the step had already been taken several years ago: many Linux distributions (like Fedora) have been using this option for Perl, and OS X has enforced the same for many years.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<h2 id="Subroutine-signatures-moved-before-attributes">Subroutine signatures moved before attributes</h2>

<p>The experimental sub signatures feature, as introduced in 5.20, parsed signatures after attributes. In this release, following feedback from users of the experimental feature, the positioning has been moved such that signatures occur after the subroutine name (if any) and before the attribute list (if any).</p>

<h2 id="and-prototypes-accepts-only-subs"><code>&amp;</code> and <code>\&amp;</code> prototypes accepts only subs</h2>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> prototype character now accepts only anonymous subs (<code>sub {...}</code>), things beginning with <code>\&amp;</code>, or an explicit <code>undef</code>. Formerly it erroneously also allowed references to arrays, hashes, and lists. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4539">[perl #4539]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123062">[perl #123062]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123475">[perl #123062]</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the <code>\&amp;</code> prototype was allowing subroutine calls, whereas now it only allows subroutines: <code>&amp;foo</code> is still permitted as an argument, while <code>&amp;foo()</code> and <code>foo()</code> no longer are. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77860">[perl #77860]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-encoding-is-now-lexical"><code>use encoding</code> is now lexical</h2>

<p>The <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/encoding.html">encoding</a> pragma&#39;s effect is now limited to lexical scope. This pragma is deprecated, but in the meantime, it could adversely affect unrelated modules that are included in the same program; this change fixes that.</p>

<h2 id="List-slices-returning-empty-lists">List slices returning empty lists</h2>

<p>List slices now return an empty list only if the original list was empty (or if there are no indices). Formerly, a list slice would return an empty list if all indices fell outside the original list; now it returns a list of <code>undef</code> values in that case. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=114498">[perl #114498]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="N-with-a-sequence-of-multiple-spaces-is-now-a-fatal-error"><code>\N{}</code> with a sequence of multiple spaces is now a fatal error</h2>

<p>E.g. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>\N{TOO  MANY SPACES}</code></span> or <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>\N{TRAILING SPACE }</code></span>. This has been deprecated since v5.18.</p>

<h2 id="use-UNIVERSAL-...-is-now-a-fatal-error"><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use UNIVERSAL &#39;...&#39;</code></span> is now a fatal error</h2>

<p>Importing functions from <code>UNIVERSAL</code> has been deprecated since v5.12, and is now a fatal error. <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use UNIVERSAL</code></span> without any arguments is still allowed.</p>

<h2 id="In-double-quotish-cX-X-must-now-be-a-printable-ASCII-character">In double-quotish <code>\c<i>X</i></code>, <i>X</i> must now be a printable ASCII character</h2>

<p>In prior releases, failure to do this raised a deprecation warning.</p>

<h2 id="Splitting-the-tokens-and-in-regular-expressions-is-now-a-fatal-compilation-error">Splitting the tokens <code>(?</code> and <code>(*</code> in regular expressions is now a fatal compilation error.</h2>

<p>These had been deprecated since v5.18.</p>

<h2 id="qr-foo-x-now-ignores-all-Unicode-pattern-white-space"><code>qr/foo/x</code> now ignores all Unicode pattern white space</h2>

<p>The <code>/x</code> regular expression modifier allows the pattern to contain white space and comments (both of which are ignored) for improved readability. Until now, not all the white space characters that Unicode designates for this purpose were handled. The additional ones now recognized are:</p>

<pre><code>    U+0085 NEXT LINE
    U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
    U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK
    U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR
    U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR</code></pre>

<p>The use of these characters with <code>/x</code> outside bracketed character classes and when not preceded by a backslash has raised a deprecation warning since v5.18. Now they will be ignored.</p>

<h2 id="Comment-lines-within-are-now-ended-only-by-a-n">Comment lines within <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>(?[ ])</code></span> are now ended only by a <code>\n</code></h2>

<p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>(?[ ])</code></span> is an experimental feature, introduced in v5.18. It operates as if <code>/x</code> is always enabled. But there was a difference: comment lines (following a <code>#</code> character) were terminated by anything matching <code>\R</code> which includes all vertical whitespace, such as form feeds. For consistency, this is now changed to match what terminates comment lines outside <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>(?[ ])</code></span>, namely a <code>\n</code> (even if escaped), which is the same as what terminates a heredoc string and formats.</p>

<h2 id="operators-now-follow-standard-Perl-precedence"><code>(?[...])</code> operators now follow standard Perl precedence</h2>

<p>This experimental feature allows set operations in regular expression patterns. Prior to this, the intersection operator had the same precedence as the other binary operators. Now it has higher precedence. This could lead to different outcomes than existing code expects (though the documentation has always noted that this change might happen, recommending fully parenthesizing the expressions). See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlrecharclass.html#Extended-Bracketed-Character-Classes">&quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Omitting-and-on-hash-and-array-names-is-no-longer-permitted">Omitting <code>%</code> and <code>@</code> on hash and array names is no longer permitted</h2>

<p>Really old Perl let you omit the <code>@</code> on array names and the <code>%</code> on hash names in some spots. This has issued a deprecation warning since Perl 5.000, and is no longer permitted.</p>

<h2 id="text-is-now-in-English-outside-the-scope-of-use-locale"><code>&quot;$!&quot;</code> text is now in English outside the scope of <code>use locale</code></h2>

<p>Previously, the text, unlike almost everything else, always came out based on the current underlying locale of the program. (Also affected on some systems is <code>&quot;$^E&quot;</code>.) For programs that are unprepared to handle locale differences, this can cause garbage text to be displayed. It&#39;s better to display text that is translatable via some tool than garbage text which is much harder to figure out.</p>

<h2 id="text-will-be-returned-in-UTF-8-when-appropriate"><code>&quot;$!&quot;</code> text will be returned in UTF-8 when appropriate</h2>

<p>The stringification of <code>$!</code> and <code>$^E</code> will have the UTF-8 flag set when the text is actually non-ASCII UTF-8. This will enable programs that are set up to be locale-aware to properly output messages in the user&#39;s native language. Code that needs to continue the 5.20 and earlier behavior can do the stringification within the scopes of both <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use bytes</code></span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use locale &quot;:messages&quot;</code></span>. Within these two scopes, no other Perl operations will be affected by locale; only <code>$!</code> and <code>$^E</code> stringification. The <code>bytes</code> pragma causes the UTF-8 flag to not be set, just as in previous Perl releases. This resolves <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=112208">[perl #112208]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Support-for-PATTERN-without-explicit-operator-has-been-removed">Support for <code>?PATTERN?</code> without explicit operator has been removed</h2>

<p>The <code>m?PATTERN?</code> construct, which allows matching a regex only once, previously had an alternative form that was written directly with a question mark delimiter, omitting the explicit <code>m</code> operator. This usage has produced a deprecation warning since 5.14.0. It is now a syntax error, so that the question mark can be available for use in new operators.</p>

<h2 id="defined-array-and-defined-hash-are-now-fatal-errors"><code>defined(@array)</code> and <code>defined(%hash)</code> are now fatal errors</h2>

<p>These have been deprecated since v5.6.1 and have raised deprecation warnings since v5.16.</p>

<h2 id="Using-a-hash-or-an-array-as-a-reference-are-now-fatal-errors">Using a hash or an array as a reference are now fatal errors</h2>

<p>For example, <code>%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}</code> now causes a fatal compilation error. These have been deprecated since before v5.8, and have raised deprecation warnings since then.</p>

<h2 id="Changes-to-the-prototype">Changes to the <code>*</code> prototype</h2>

<p>The <code>*</code> character in a subroutine&#39;s prototype used to allow barewords to take precedence over most, but not all, subroutine names. It was never consistent and exhibited buggy behavior.</p>

<p>Now it has been changed, so subroutines always take precedence over barewords, which brings it into conformity with similarly prototyped built-in functions:</p>

<pre><code>    sub splat(*) { ... }
    sub foo { ... }
    splat(foo); # now always splat(foo())
    splat(bar); # still splat(&#39;bar&#39;) as before
    close(foo); # close(foo())
    close(bar); # close(&#39;bar&#39;)</code></pre>

<h1 id="Deprecations">Deprecations</h1>

<h2 id="Setting-ENCODING-to-anything-but-undef">Setting <code>${^ENCODING}</code> to anything but <code>undef</code></h2>

<p>This variable allows Perl scripts to be written in an encoding other than ASCII or UTF-8. However, it affects all modules globally, leading to wrong answers and segmentation faults. New scripts should be written in UTF-8; old scripts should be converted to UTF-8, which is easily done with the <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/utils/piconv.html">piconv</a> utility.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-non-graphic-characters-in-single-character-variable-names">Use of non-graphic characters in single-character variable names</h2>

<p>The syntax for single-character variable names is more lenient than for longer variable names, allowing the one-character name to be a punctuation character or even invisible (a non-graphic). Perl v5.20 deprecated the ASCII-range controls as such a name. Now, all non-graphic characters that formerly were allowed are deprecated. The practical effect of this occurs only when not under <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use utf8</span></code>, and affects just the C1 controls (code points 0x80 through 0xFF), NO-BREAK SPACE, and SOFT HYPHEN.</p>

<h2 id="Inlining-of-sub-var-with-observable-side-effects">Inlining of <code>sub () { $var }</code> with observable side-effects</h2>

<p>In many cases Perl makes <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>sub () { $var }</code></span> into an inlinable constant subroutine, capturing the value of <code>$var</code> at the time the <code>sub</code> expression is evaluated. This can break the closure behavior in those cases where <code>$var</code> is subsequently modified, since the subroutine won&#39;t return the changed value. (Note that this all only applies to anonymous subroutines with an empty prototype (<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>sub ()</code></span>).)</p>

<p>This usage is now deprecated in those cases where the variable could be modified elsewhere. Perl detects those cases and emits a deprecation warning. Such code will likely change in the future and stop producing a constant.</p>

<p>If your variable is only modified in the place where it is declared, then Perl will continue to make the sub inlinable with no warnings.</p>

<pre><code>    sub make_constant {
        my $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # fine
    }

    sub make_constant_deprecated {
        my $var;
        $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }

    sub make_constant_deprecated2 {
        my $var = shift;
        log_that_value($var); # could modify $var
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }</code></pre>

<p>In the second example above, detecting that <code>$var</code> is assigned to only once is too hard to detect. That it happens in a spot other than the <code>my</code> declaration is enough for Perl to find it suspicious.</p>

<p>This deprecation warning happens only for a simple variable for the body of the sub. (A <code>BEGIN</code> block or <code>use</code> statement inside the sub is ignored, because it does not become part of the sub&#39;s body.) For more complex cases, such as <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>sub () { do_something() if 0; $var }</code></span> the behavior has changed such that inlining does not happen if the variable is modifiable elsewhere. Such cases should be rare.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-multiple-x-regexp-modifiers">Use of multiple <code>/x</code> regexp modifiers</h2>

<p>It is now deprecated to say something like any of the following:</p>

<pre><code>    qr/foo/xx;
    /(?xax:foo)/;
    use re qw(/amxx);</code></pre>

<p>That is, now <code>x</code> should only occur once in any string of contiguous regular expression pattern modifiers. We do not believe there are any occurrences of this in all of CPAN. This is in preparation for a future Perl release having <code>/xx</code> permit white-space for readability in bracketed character classes (those enclosed in square brackets: <code>[...]</code>).</p>

<h2 id="Using-a-NO-BREAK-space-in-a-character-alias-for-N-...-is-now-deprecated">Using a NO-BREAK space in a character alias for <code>\N{...}</code> is now deprecated</h2>

<p>This non-graphic character is essentially indistinguishable from a regular space, and so should not be allowed. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/charnames.html#CUSTOM-ALIASES">&quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames</a>.</p>

<h2 id="A-literal-should-now-be-escaped-in-a-pattern">A literal <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> should now be escaped in a pattern</h2>

<p>If you want a literal left curly bracket (also called a left brace) in a regular expression pattern, you should now escape it by either preceding it with a backslash (<code>&quot;\{&quot;</code>) or enclosing it within square brackets <code>&quot;[{]&quot;</code>, or by using <code>\Q</code>; otherwise a deprecation warning will be raised. This was first announced as forthcoming in the v5.16 release; it will allow future extensions to the language to happen.</p>

<h2 id="Making-all-warnings-fatal-is-discouraged">Making all warnings fatal is discouraged</h2>

<p>The documentation for <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/warnings.html#Fatal-Warnings">fatal warnings</a> notes that <code>use warnings FATAL =&gt; &#39;all&#39;</code> is discouraged, and provides stronger language about the risks of fatal warnings in general.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>If a method or class name is known at compile time, a hash is precomputed to speed up run-time method lookup. Also, compound method names like <code>SUPER::new</code> are parsed at compile time, to save having to parse them at run time.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Array and hash lookups (especially nested ones) that use only constants or simple variables as keys, are now considerably faster. See <a href="#Internal-Changes">&quot;Internal Changes&quot;</a> for more details.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>(...)x1</code>, <code>(&quot;constant&quot;)x0</code> and <code>($scalar)x0</code> are now optimised in list context. If the right-hand argument is a constant 1, the repetition operator disappears. If the right-hand argument is a constant 0, the whole expression is optimised to the empty list, so long as the left-hand argument is a simple scalar or constant. (That is, <code>(foo())x0</code> is not subject to this optimisation.)</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>substr</code> assignment is now optimised into 4-argument <code>substr</code> at the end of a subroutine (or as the argument to <code>return</code>). Previously, this optimisation only happened in void context.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In <code>&quot;\L...&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;\Q...&quot;</code>, etc., the extra &quot;stringify&quot; op is now optimised away, making these just as fast as <code>lcfirst</code>, <code>quotemeta</code>, etc.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Assignment to an empty list is now sometimes faster. In particular, it never calls <code>FETCH</code> on tied arguments on the right-hand side, whereas it used to sometimes.</p>

</li>
<li><p>There is a performance improvement of up to 20% when <code>length</code> is applied to a non-magical, non-tied string, and either <code>use bytes</code> is in scope or the string doesn&#39;t use UTF-8 internally.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On most perl builds with 64-bit integers, memory usage for non-magical, non-tied scalars containing only a floating point value has been reduced by between 8 and 32 bytes, depending on OS.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In <code>@array = split</code>, the assignment can be optimized away, so that <code>split</code> writes directly to the array. This optimisation was happening only for package arrays other than <code>@_</code>, and only sometimes. Now this optimisation happens almost all the time.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>join</code> is now subject to constant folding. So for example <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>join &quot;-&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;</code></span> is converted at compile-time to <code>&quot;a-b&quot;</code>. Moreover, <code>join</code> with a scalar or constant for the separator and a single-item list to join is simplified to a stringification, and the separator doesn&#39;t even get evaluated.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>qq(@array)</code> is implemented using two ops: a stringify op and a join op. If the <code>qq</code> contains nothing but a single array, the stringification is optimized away.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>our $var</code></span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>our($s,@a,%h)</code></span> in void context are no longer evaluated at run time. Even a whole sequence of <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>our $foo;</code></span> statements will simply be skipped over. The same applies to <code>state</code> variables.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Many internal functions have been refactored to improve performance and reduce their memory footprints. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121436">[perl #121436]</a> <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121906">[perl #121906]</a> <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121969">[perl #121969]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>-T</code> and <code>-B</code> filetests will return sooner when an empty file is detected. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121489">[perl #121489]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Hash lookups where the key is a constant are faster.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Subroutines with an empty prototype and a body containing just <code>undef</code> are now eligible for inlining. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122728">[perl #122728]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Subroutines in packages no longer need to be stored in typeglobs: declaring a subroutine will now put a simple sub reference directly in the stash if possible, saving memory. The typeglob still notionally exists, so accessing it will cause the stash entry to be upgraded to a typeglob (<i>i.e.</i> this is just an internal implementation detail). This optimization does not currently apply to XSUBs or exported subroutines, and method calls will undo it, since they cache things in typeglobs. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441">[perl #120441]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>The functions <code>utf8::native_to_unicode()</code> and <code>utf8::unicode_to_native()</code> (see <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/utf8.html">utf8</a>) are now optimized out on ASCII platforms. There is now not even a minimal performance hit in writing code portable between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Win32 Perl uses 8 KB less of per-process memory than before for every perl process, because some data is now memory mapped from disk and shared between processes from the same perl binary.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Modules-and-Pragmata">Modules and Pragmata</h1>

<p>Some notable changes include:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/Archive/Tar.html">Archive::Tar</a> has been upgraded to version 2.04.</p>

<p>Tests can now be run in parallel.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/attributes.html">attributes</a> has been upgraded to version 0.27.</p>

<p>The usage of <code>memEQs</code> in the XS has been corrected. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122701">[perl #122701]</a></p>

<p>Avoid reading beyond the end of a buffer. [perl #122629]</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/B.html">B</a> has been upgraded to version 1.58.</p>

<p>It provides a new <code>B::safename</code> function, based on the existing <code>B::GV-&gt;SAFENAME</code>, that converts <code>\cOPEN</code> to <code>^OPEN</code>.</p>

<p>Nulled COPs are now of class <code>B::COP</code>, rather than <code>B::OP</code>.</p>

<p><code>B::REGEXP</code> objects now provide a <code>qr_anoncv</code> method for accessing the implicit CV associated with <code>qr//</code> things containing code blocks, and a <code>compflags</code> method that returns the pertinent flags originating from the <code>qr//blahblah</code> op.</p>

<p><code>B::PMOP</code> now provides a <code>pmregexp</code> method returning a <code>B::REGEXP</code> object. Two new classes, <code>B::PADNAME</code> and <code>B::PADNAMELIST</code>, have been introduced.</p>

<p>A bug where, after an ithread creation or psuedofork, special/immortal SVs in the child ithread/psuedoprocess did not have the correct class of <code>B::SPECIAL</code>, has been fixed. The <code>id</code> and <code>outid</code> PADLIST methods have been added.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/B/Concise.html">B::Concise</a> has been upgraded to version 0.996.</p>

<p>Null ops that are part of the execution chain are now given sequence numbers.</p>

<p>Private flags for nulled ops are now dumped with mnemonics as they would be for the non-nulled counterparts.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/B/Deparse.html">B::Deparse</a> has been upgraded to version 1.35.</p>

<p>It now deparses <code>+sub : attr { ... }</code> correctly at the start of a statement. Without the initial <code>+</code>, <code>sub</code> would be a statement label.</p>

<p><code>BEGIN</code> blocks are now emitted in the right place most of the time, but the change unfortunately introduced a regression, in that <code>BEGIN</code> blocks occurring just before the end of the enclosing block may appear below it instead.</p>

<p><code>B::Deparse</code> no longer puts erroneous <code>local</code> here and there, such as for <code>LIST = tr/a//d</code>. [perl #119815]</p>

<p>Adjacent <code>use</code> statements are no longer accidentally nested if one contains a <code>do</code> block. [perl #115066]</p>

<p>Parenthesised arrays in lists passed to <code>\</code> are now correctly deparsed with parentheses (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>\(@a, (@b), @c)</code> now retains the parentheses around @b), thus preserving the flattening behavior of referenced parenthesised arrays. Formerly, it only worked for one array: <code>\(@a)</code>.</p>

<p><code>local our</code> is now deparsed correctly, with the <code>our</code> included.</p>

<p><code>for($foo; !$bar; $baz) {...}</code> was deparsed without the <code>!</code> (or <code>not</code>). This has been fixed.</p>

<p>Core keywords that conflict with lexical subroutines are now deparsed with the <code>CORE::</code> prefix.</p>

<p><code>foreach state $x (...) {...}</code> now deparses correctly with <code>state</code> and not <code>my</code>.</p>

<p><code>our @array = split(...)</code> now deparses correctly with <code>our</code> in those cases where the assignment is optimized away.</p>

<p>It now deparses <code>our(<i>LIST</i>)</code> and typed lexical (<code>my Dog $spot</code>) correctly.</p>

<p>Deparse <code>$#_</code> as that instead of as <code>$#{_}</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123947">[perl #123947]</a></p>

<p>BEGIN blocks at the end of the enclosing scope are now deparsed in the right place. [perl #77452]</p>

<p>BEGIN blocks were sometimes deparsed as __ANON__, but are now always called BEGIN.</p>

<p>Lexical subroutines are now fully deparsed. [perl #116553]</p>

<p><code>Anything =~ y///r</code> with <code>/r</code> no longer omits the left-hand operand.</p>

<p>The op trees that make up regexp code blocks are now deparsed for real. Formerly, the original string that made up the regular expression was used. That caused problems with <code>qr/(?{&lt;&lt;heredoc})/</code> and multiline code blocks, which were deparsed incorrectly. [perl #123217] [perl #115256]</p>

<p><code>$;</code> at the end of a statement no longer loses its semicolon. [perl #123357]</p>

<p>Some cases of subroutine declarations stored in the stash in shorthand form were being omitted.</p>

<p>Non-ASCII characters are now consistently escaped in strings, instead of some of the time. (There are still outstanding problems with regular expressions and identifiers that have not been fixed.)</p>

<p>When prototype sub calls are deparsed with <code>&amp;</code> (<i>e.g.</i>, under the <b>-P</b> option), <code>scalar</code> is now added where appropriate, to force the scalar context implied by the prototype.</p>

<p><code>require(foo())</code>, <code>do(foo())</code>, <code>goto(foo())</code> and similar constructs with loop controls are now deparsed correctly. The outer parentheses are not optional.</p>

<p>Whitespace is no longer escaped in regular expressions, because it was getting erroneously escaped within <code>(?x:...)</code> sections.</p>

<p><code>sub foo { foo() }</code> is now deparsed with those mandatory parentheses.</p>

<p><code>/@array/</code> is now deparsed as a regular expression, and not just <code>@array</code>.</p>

<p><code>/@{-}/</code>, <code>/@{+}/</code> and <code>$#{1}</code> are now deparsed with the braces, which are mandatory in these cases.</p>

<p>In deparsing feature bundles, <code>B::Deparse</code> was emitting <code>no feature;</code> first instead of <code>no feature &#39;:all&#39;;</code>. This has been fixed.</p>

<p><code>chdir FH</code> is now deparsed without quotation marks.</p>

<p><code>\my @a</code> is now deparsed without parentheses. (Parenthese would flatten the array.)</p>

<p><code>system</code> and <code>exec</code> followed by a block are now deparsed correctly. Formerly there was an erroneous <code>do</code> before the block.</p>

<h3 id="New-Errors">New Errors</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Bad-symbol-for-scalar">Bad symbol for scalar</a></p>

<p>(P) An internal request asked to add a scalar entry to something that wasn&#39;t a symbol table entry.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Can-t-use-a-hash-as-a-reference">Can&#39;t use a hash as a reference</a></p>

<p>(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in <code>%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}</code> or <code>%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}</code>. Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&#39;t have.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Can-t-use-an-array-as-a-reference">Can&#39;t use an array as a reference</a></p>

<p>(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in <code>@foo-&gt;[23]</code> or <code>@$ref-&gt;[99]</code>. Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn&#39;t have.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Can-t-use-defined-array-Maybe-you-should-just-omit-the-defined">Can&#39;t use &#39;defined(@array)&#39; (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)</a></p>

<p>(F) <code>defined()</code> is not useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value. If you want to see if the array is empty, just use <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>if (@array) { # not empty }</code></span> for example.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Can-t-use-defined-hash-Maybe-you-should-just-omit-the-defined">Can&#39;t use &#39;defined(%hash)&#39; (Maybe you should just omit the defined()?)</a></p>

<p>(F) <code>defined()</code> is not usually right on hashes.</p>

<p>Although <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>defined %hash</code></span> is false on a plain not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash names, even remaining true after <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>undef %hash</code></span>. These things make <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>defined %hash</code></span> fairly useless in practice, so it now generates a fatal error.</p>

<p>If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it in boolean context (see <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldata.html#Scalar-values">&quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata</a>):</p>

<pre><code>    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }</code></pre>

<p>If you had <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>defined %Foo::Bar::QUUX</code></span> to check whether such a package variable exists then that&#39;s never really been reliable, and isn&#39;t a good way to enquire about the features of a package, or whether it&#39;s loaded, etc.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Cannot-chr-f">Cannot chr %f</a></p>

<p>(F) You passed an invalid number (like an infinity or not-a-number) to <code>chr</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Cannot-compress-f-in-pack">Cannot compress %f in pack</a></p>

<p>(F) You tried converting an infinity or not-a-number to an unsigned character, which makes no sense.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Cannot-pack-f-with-c">Cannot pack %f with &#39;%c&#39;</a></p>

<p>(F) You tried converting an infinity or not-a-number to a character, which makes no sense.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Cannot-printf-f-with-c">Cannot print %f with &#39;%c&#39;</a></p>

<p>(F) You tried printing an infinity or not-a-number as a character (<code>%c</code>), which makes no sense. Maybe you meant <code>&#39;%s&#39;</code>, or just stringifying it?</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#charnames-alias-definitions-may-not-contain-a-sequence-of-multiple-spaces">charnames alias definitions may not contain a sequence of multiple spaces</a></p>

<p>(F) You defined a character name which had multiple space characters in a row. Change them to single spaces. Usually these names are defined in the <code>:alias</code> import argument to <code>use charnames</code>, but they could be defined by a translator installed into <code>$^H{charnames}</code>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/charnames.html#CUSTOM-ALIASES">&quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#charnames-alias-definitions-may-not-contain-trailing-white-space">charnames alias definitions may not contain trailing white-space</a></p>

<p>(F) You defined a character name which ended in a space character. Remove the trailing space(s). Usually these names are defined in the <code>:alias</code> import argument to <code>use charnames</code>, but they could be defined by a translator installed into <code>$^H{charnames}</code>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/charnames.html#CUSTOM-ALIASES">&quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot; in charnames</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#const-is-not-permitted-on-named-subroutines">:const is not permitted on named subroutines</a></p>

<p>(F) The <code>const</code> attribute causes an anonymous subroutine to be run and its value captured at the time that it is cloned. Named subroutines are not cloned like this, so the attribute does not make sense on them.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Hexadecimal-float:-internal-error">Hexadecimal float: internal error</a></p>

<p>(F) Something went horribly bad in hexadecimal float handling.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Hexadecimal-float:-unsupported-long-double-format">Hexadecimal float: unsupported long double format</a></p>

<p>(F) You have configured Perl to use long doubles but the internals of the long double format are unknown, therefore the hexadecimal float output is impossible.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Illegal-suidscript">Illegal suidscript</a></p>

<p>(F) The script run under suidperl was somehow illegal.</p>

<p>(F) The two-character sequence <code>&quot;(?&quot;</code> in this context in a regular expression pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing intervening between the <code>&quot;(&quot;</code> and the <code>&quot;?&quot;</code>, but you separated them.</p>

<p>(F) The two-character sequence <code>&quot;(*&quot;</code> in this context in a regular expression pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing intervening between the <code>&quot;(&quot;</code> and the <code>&quot;*&quot;</code>, but you separated them.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Invalid-quantifier-in-in-regex-marked-by----HERE-in-m-s">Invalid quantifier in {,} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</a></p>

<p>(F) The pattern looks like a {min,max} quantifier, but the min or max could not be parsed as a valid number: either it has leading zeroes, or it represents too big a number to cope with. The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> shows where in the regular expression the problem was discovered. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html">perlre</a>.</p>

<p>(F) You used <code>\b{...}</code> or <code>\B{...}</code> and the <code>...</code> is not known to Perl. The current valid ones are given in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlrebackslash.html#b-b-B-B">&quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Missing-or-undefined-argument-to-require">Missing or undefined argument to require</a></p>

<p>(F) You tried to call <code>require</code> with no argument or with an undefined value as an argument. <code>require</code> expects either a package name or a file-specification as an argument. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlfunc.html#require">&quot;require&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<p>Formerly, <code>require</code> with no argument or <code>undef</code> warned about a Null filename.</p>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#C-is-deprecated-in-regex-marked-by----HERE-in-m-s">\C is deprecated in regex</a></p>

<p>(D deprecated) The <code>/\C/</code> character class was deprecated in v5.20, and now emits a warning. It is intended that it will become an error in v5.24. This character class matches a single byte even if it appears within a multi-byte character, breaks encapsulation, and can corrupt UTF-8 strings.</p>

<p>(W regexp) (only under <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use re &#39;strict&#39;</span></code> or within <code>(?[...])</code>)</p>

<p>You specified a character that has the given plainer way of writing it, and which is also portable to platforms running with different character sets.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Argument-s-treated-as-0-in-increment">Argument &quot;%s&quot; treated as 0 in increment (++)</a></p>

<p>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to the <code>++</code> operator which expects either a number or a string matching <code>/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/</code>.

<p>(W regexp) (only under <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use re &#39;strict&#39;</span></code> or within <code>(?[...])</code>)</p>

<p>In a bracketed character class in a regular expression pattern, you had a range which has exactly one end of it specified using <code>\N{}</code>, and the other end is specified using a non-portable mechanism. Perl treats the range as a Unicode range, that is, all the characters in it are considered to be the Unicode characters, and which may be different code points on some platforms Perl runs on. For example, <code>[\N{U+06}-\x08]</code> is treated as if you had instead said <code>[\N{U+06}-\N{U+08}]</code>, that is it matches the characters whose code points in Unicode are 6, 7, and 8. But that <code>\x08</code> might indicate that you meant something different, so the warning gets raised.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Can-t-do-s-s-on-non-UTF-8-locale-resolved-to-s">Can&#39;t do %s(&quot;%s&quot;) on non-UTF-8 locale; resolved to &quot;%s&quot;.</a></p>

<p>(W locale) You are 1) running under &quot;<code>use locale</code>&quot;; 2) the current locale is not a UTF-8 one; 3) you tried to do the designated case-change operation on the specified Unicode character; and 4) the result of this operation would mix Unicode and locale rules, which likely conflict.</p>

<p>The warnings category <code>locale</code> is new.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#const-is-experimental">:const is experimental</a></p>

<p>(S experimental::const_attr) The <code>const</code> attribute is experimental. If you want to use the feature, disable the warning with <code>no warnings &#39;experimental::const_attr&#39;</code>, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk that your code may break in a future Perl version.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#gmtime-f-failed">gmtime(%f) failed</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Hexadecimal-float:-mantissa-overflow">Hexadecimal float: mantissa overflow</a></p>

<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point literal had more bits in the mantissa (the part between the <code>0x</code> and the exponent, also known as the fraction or the significand) than the floating point supports.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Hexadecimal-float:-precision-loss">Hexadecimal float: precision loss</a></p>

<p>(W overflow) The hexadecimal floating point had internally more digits than could be output. This can be caused by unsupported long double formats, or by 64-bit integers not being available (needed to retrieve the digits under some configurations).</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Locale-s-may-not-work-well.-s">Locale &#39;%s&#39; may not work well.%s</a></p>

<p>(W locale) You are using the named locale, which is a non-UTF-8 one, and which perl has determined is not fully compatible with what it can handle. The second <code>%s</code> gives a reason.</p>

<p>The warnings category <code>locale</code> is new.</p>

</li>

<p>(W regexp) (only under <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use re &#39;strict&#39;</span></code> or within <code>(?[...])</code>)</p>

<p>Stricter rules help to find typos and other errors. Perhaps you didn&#39;t even intend a range here, if the <code>&quot;-&quot;</code> was meant to be some other character, or should have been escaped (like <code>&quot;\-&quot;</code>). If you did intend a range, the one that was used is not portable between ASCII and EBCDIC platforms, and doesn&#39;t have an obvious meaning to a casual reader.</p>

<pre><code> [3-7]    # OK; Obvious and portable
 [d-g]    # OK; Obvious and portable
 [A-Y]    # OK; Obvious and portable
 [A-z]    # WRONG; Not portable; not clear what is meant
 [a-Z]    # WRONG; Not portable; not clear what is meant
 [%-.]    # WRONG; Not portable; not clear what is meant
 [\x41-Z] # WRONG; Not portable; not obvious to non-geek</code></pre>

<p>(You can force portability by specifying a Unicode range, which means that the endpoints are specified by <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlrecharclass.html#Character-Ranges"><code>\N{...}</code></a>, but the meaning may still not be obvious.) The stricter rules require that ranges that start or stop with an ASCII character that is not a control have all their endpoints be a literal character, and not some escape sequence (like <code>&quot;\x41&quot;</code>), and the ranges must be all digits, or all uppercase letters, or all lowercase letters.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Ranges-of-digits-should-be-from-the-same-group-in-regex-marked-by----HERE-in-m-s">Ranges of digits should be from the same group in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/</a></p>

<p>(W regexp) (only under <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use re &#39;strict&#39;</span></code> or within <code>(?[...])</code>)</p>

<p>Stricter rules help to find typos and other errors. You included a range, and at least one of the end points is a decimal digit. Under the stricter rules, when this happens, both end points should be digits in the same group of 10 consecutive digits.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Redundant-argument-in-s">Redundant argument in %s</a></p>

<p>(W redundant) You called a function with more arguments than were needed, as indicated by information within other arguments you supplied (<i>e.g</i>. a printf format). Currently only emitted when a printf-type format required fewer arguments than were supplied, but might be used in the future for <i>e.g.</i> <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlfunc.html#pack">&quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc</a>.</p>

<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Replacement-list-is-longer-than-search-list">Replacement list is longer than search list</a></p>

<p>This is not a new diagnostic, but in earlier releases was accidentally not displayed if the transliteration contained wide characters. This is now fixed, so that you may see this diagnostic in places where you previously didn&#39;t (but should have).</p>

<p>(W locale) You are matching a regular expression using locale rules, and a Unicode boundary is being matched, but the locale is not a Unicode one. This doesn&#39;t make sense. Perl will continue, assuming a Unicode (UTF-8) locale, but the results could well be wrong except if the locale happens to be ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) where this message is spurious and can be ignored.</p>

<p>(W regexp) You used a Unicode boundary (<code>\b{...}</code> or <code>\B{...}</code>) in a portion of a regular expression where the character set modifiers <code>/a</code> or <code>/aa</code> are in effect. These two modifiers indicate an ASCII interpretation, and this doesn&#39;t make sense for a Unicode definition. The generated regular expression will compile so that the boundary uses all of Unicode.

<p>(S experimental::bitwise) This warning is emitted if you use bitwise operators (<code>&amp; | ^ ~ &amp;. |. ^. ~.</code>) with the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature enabled. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl version:</p>

<p>(D deprecated, regexp) You used a literal <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> character in a regular expression pattern. You should change to use <code>&quot;\{&quot;</code> instead, because a future version of Perl (tentatively v5.26) will consider this to be a syntax error. If the pattern delimiters are also braces, any matching right brace (<code>&quot;}&quot;</code>) should also be escaped to avoid confusing the parser, for example,</p>

<p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Warning:-unable-to-close-filehandle-s-properly:-s">Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly: %s</a></p>

<p>(S io) Previously, perl silently ignored any errors when doing an implicit close of a filehandle, <i>i.e.</i> where the reference count of the filehandle reached zero and the user&#39;s code hadn&#39;t already called <code>close()</code>; <i>e.g.</i></p>

<pre><code>    {
        open my $fh, &#39;&gt;&#39;, $file  or die &quot;open: &#39;$file&#39;: $!\n&quot;;
        print $fh, $data  or die;
    } # implicit close here</code></pre>

<p>In a situation such as disk full, due to buffering, the error may only be detected during the final close, so not checking the result of the close is dangerous.</p>

<p>So perl now warns in such situations.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perldiag.html#Wide-character-U-X-in-s">Wide character (U+%X) in %s</a></p>

<p>(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8 one), a multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers this character to be the specified Unicode code point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode is dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two different representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will make string comparisons unreliable.</p>

<p>You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character got mixed up with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you had a UTF-8 locale, but Perl disagrees).</p>

<p>The warnings category <code>locale</code> is new.</p>

However the version of <code>Pod::Simple</code> currently on CPAN should work; it was fixed too late to include in Perl 5.22.

<h1 id="Internal-Changes">Internal Changes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Experimental support has been added to allow ops in the optree to locate their parent, if any. This is enabled by the non-default build option <code>-DPERL_OP_PARENT</code>. It is envisaged that this will eventually become enabled by default, so XS code which directly accesses the <code>op_sibling</code> field of ops should be updated to be future-proofed.</p>

<p>On <code>PERL_OP_PARENT</code> builds, the <code>op_sibling</code> field has been renamed <code>op_sibparent</code> and a new flag, <code>op_moresib</code>, added. On the last op in a sibling chain, <code>op_moresib</code> is false and <code>op_sibparent</code> points to the parent (if any) rather than being <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>To make existing code work transparently whether using <code>PERL_OP_PARENT</code> or not, a number of new macros and functions have been added that should be used, rather than directly manipulating <code>op_sibling</code>.</p>

<p>For the case of just reading <code>op_sibling</code> to determine the next sibling, two new macros have been added. A simple scan through a sibling chain like this:</p>

<pre><code>    for (; kid-&gt;op_sibling; kid = kid-&gt;op_sibling) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>should now be written as:</p>

<pre><code>    for (; OpHAS_SIBLING(kid); kid = OpSIBLING(kid)) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>For altering optrees, a general-purpose function <code>op_sibling_splice()</code> has been added, which allows for manipulation of a chain of sibling ops. By analogy with the Perl function <code>splice()</code>, it allows you to cut out zero or more ops from a sibling chain and replace them with zero or more new ops. It transparently handles all the updating of sibling, parent, op_last pointers etc.</p>

<p>If you need to manipulate ops at a lower level, then three new macros, <code>OpMORESIB_set</code>, <code>OpLASTSIB_set</code> and <code>OpMAYBESIB_set</code> are intended to be a low-level portable way to set <code>op_sibling</code> / <code>op_sibparent</code> while also updating <code>op_moresib</code>. The first sets the sibling pointer to a new sibling, the second makes the op the last sibling, and the third conditionally does the first or second action. Note that unlike <code>op_sibling_splice()</code> these macros won&#39;t maintain consistency in the parent at the same time (<i>e.g.</i> by updating <code>op_first</code> and <code>op_last</code> where appropriate).</p>

<p>A C-level <code>Perl_op_parent()</code> function and a Perl-level <code>B::OP::parent()</code> method have been added. The C function only exists under <code>PERL_OP_PARENT</code> builds (using it is build-time error on vanilla perls). <code>B::OP::parent()</code> exists always, but on a vanilla build it always returns <code>NULL</code>. Under <code>PERL_OP_PARENT</code>, they return the parent of the current op, if any. The variable <code>$B::OP::does_parent</code> allows you to determine whether <code>B</code> supports retrieving an op&#39;s parent.</p>

<p><code>PERL_OP_PARENT</code> was introduced in 5.21.2, but the interface was changed considerably in 5.21.11. If you updated your code before the 5.21.11 changes, it may require further revision. The main changes after 5.21.2 were:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>OP_SIBLING</code> and <code>OP_HAS_SIBLING</code> macros have been renamed <code>OpSIBLING</code> and <code>OpHAS_SIBLING</code> for consistency with other op-manipulating macros.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>op_lastsib</code> field has been renamed <code>op_moresib</code>, and its meaning inverted.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The macro <code>OpSIBLING_set</code> has been removed, and has been superseded by <code>OpMORESIB_set</code> <i>et al</i>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>op_sibling_splice()</code> function now accepts a null <code>parent</code> argument where the splicing doesn&#39;t affect the first or last ops in the sibling chain</p>

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>Macros have been created to allow XS code to better manipulate the POSIX locale category <code>LC_NUMERIC</code>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#Locale-related-functions-and-macros">&quot;Locale-related functions and macros&quot; in perlapi</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The previous <code>atoi</code> <i>et al</i> replacement function, <code>grok_atou</code>, has now been superseded by <code>grok_atoUV</code>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlclib.html">perlclib</a> for details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new function, <code>Perl_sv_get_backrefs()</code>, has been added which allows you retrieve the weak references, if any, which point at an SV.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>screaminstr()</code> function has been removed. Although marked as public API, it was undocumented and had no usage in CPAN modules. Calling it has been fatal since 5.17.0.</p>

<li><p>The <code>sv_magic()</code> function no longer forbids &quot;ext&quot; magic on read-only values. After all, perl can&#39;t know whether the custom magic will modify the SV or not. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123103">[perl #123103]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Accessing <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#CvPADLIST">&quot;CvPADLIST&quot; in perlapi</a> on an XSUB is now forbidden.</p>

<p>The <code>CvPADLIST</code> field has been reused for a different internal purpose for XSUBs. So in particular, you can no longer rely on it being NULL as a test of whether a CV is an XSUB. Use <code>CvISXSUB()</code> instead.</p>

</li>
<li><p>SVs of type <code>SVt_NV</code> are now sometimes bodiless when the build configuration and platform allow it: specifically, when <code>sizeof(NV) &lt;= sizeof(IV)</code>. &quot;Bodiless&quot; means that the NV value is stored directly in the head of an SV, without requiring a separate body to be allocated. This trick has already been used for IVs since 5.9.2 (though in the case of IVs, it is always used, regardless of platform and build configuration).</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>$DB::single</code>, <code>$DB::signal</code> and <code>$DB::trace</code> variables now have set- and get-magic that stores their values as IVs, and those IVs are used when testing their values in <code>pp_dbstate()</code>. This prevents perl from recursing infinitely if an overloaded object is assigned to any of those variables. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122445">[perl #122445]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>Perl_tmps_grow()</code>, which is marked as public API but is undocumented, has been removed from the public API. This change does not affect XS code that uses the <code>EXTEND_MORTAL</code> macro to pre-extend the mortal stack.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl&#39;s internals no longer sets or uses the <code>SVs_PADMY</code> flag. <code>SvPADMY()</code> now returns a true value for anything not marked <code>PADTMP</code> and <code>SVs_PADMY</code> is now defined as 0.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The macros <code>SETsv</code> and <code>SETsvUN</code> have been removed. They were no longer used in the core since commit 6f1401dc2a five years ago, and have not been found present on CPAN.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>SvFAKE</code> bit (unused on HVs) got informally reserved by David Mitchell for future work on vtables.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>sv_catpvn_flags()</code> function accepts <code>SV_CATBYTES</code> and <code>SV_CATUTF8</code> flags, which specify whether the appended string is bytes or UTF-8, respectively. (These flags have in fact been present since 5.16.0, but were formerly not regarded as part of the API.)</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new opcode class, <code>METHOP</code>, has been introduced. It holds information used at runtime to improve the performance of class/object method calls.</p>

<p><code>OP_METHOD</code> and <code>OP_METHOD_NAMED</code> have changed from being <code>UNOP/SVOP</code> to being <code>METHOP</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>cv_name()</code> is a new API function that can be passed a CV or GV. It returns an SV containing the name of the subroutine, for use in diagnostics.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116735">[perl #116735]</a> <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441">[perl #120441]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>cv_set_call_checker_flags()</code> is a new API function that works like <code>cv_set_call_checker()</code>, except that it allows the caller to specify whether the call checker requires a full GV for reporting the subroutine&#39;s name, or whether it could be passed a CV instead. Whatever value is passed will be acceptable to <code>cv_name()</code>. <code>cv_set_call_checker()</code> guarantees there will be a GV, but it may have to create one on the fly, which is inefficient. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116735">[perl #116735]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>CvGV</code> (which is not part of the API) is now a more complex macro, which may call a function and reify a GV. For those cases where it has been used as a boolean, <code>CvHASGV</code> has been added, which will return true for CVs that notionally have GVs, but without reifying the GV. <code>CvGV</code> also returns a GV now for lexical subs. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441">[perl #120441]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>The <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#sync_locale">&quot;sync_locale&quot; in perlapi</a> function has been added to the public API. Changing the program&#39;s locale should be avoided by XS code. Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries called from XS need to do so, such as <code>Gtk</code>. When this happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has changed. Use this function to do so, before returning to Perl.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The defines and labels for the flags in the <code>op_private</code> field of OPs are now auto-generated from data in <i>regen/op_private</i>. The noticeable effect of this is that some of the flag output of <code>Concise</code> might differ slightly, and the flag output of <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>perl -Dx</code></span> may differ considerably (they both use the same set of labels now). Also, debugging builds now have a new assertion in <code>op_free()</code> to ensure that the op doesn&#39;t have any unrecognized flags set in <code>op_private</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The deprecated variable <code>PL_sv_objcount</code> has been removed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl now tries to keep the locale category <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> set to &quot;C&quot; except around operations that need it to be set to the program&#39;s underlying locale. This protects the many XS modules that cannot cope with the decimal radix character not being a dot. Prior to this release, Perl initialized this category to &quot;C&quot;, but a call to <code>POSIX::setlocale()</code> would change it. Now such a call will change the underlying locale of the <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> category for the program, but the locale exposed to XS code will remain &quot;C&quot;. There are new macros to manipulate the LC_NUMERIC locale, including <code>STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED</code> and <code>STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING</code>. See <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#Locale-related-functions-and-macros">&quot;Locale-related functions and macros&quot; in perlapi</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new macro <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlapi.html#isUTF8_CHAR"><code>isUTF8_CHAR</code></a> has been written which efficiently determines if the string given by its parameters begins with a well-formed UTF-8 encoded character.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The following private API functions had their context parameter removed: <code>Perl_cast_ulong</code>, <code>Perl_cast_i32</code>, <code>Perl_cast_iv</code>, <code>Perl_cast_uv</code>, <code>Perl_cv_const_sv</code>, <code>Perl_mg_find</code>, <code>Perl_mg_findext</code>, <code>Perl_mg_magical</code>, <code>Perl_mini_mktime</code>, <code>Perl_my_dirfd</code>, <code>Perl_sv_backoff</code>, <code>Perl_utf8_hop</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the prefix-less versions of those functions that are part of the public API, such as <code>cast_i32()</code>, remain unaffected.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>PADNAME</code> and <code>PADNAMELIST</code> types are now separate types, and no longer simply aliases for SV and AV. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123223">[perl #123223]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Pad names are now always UTF-8. The <code>PadnameUTF8</code> macro always returns true. Previously, this was effectively the case already, but any support for two different internal representations of pad names has now been removed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new op class, <code>UNOP_AUX</code>, has been added. This is a subclass of <code>UNOP</code> with an <code>op_aux</code> field added, which points to an array of unions of UV, SV* etc. It is intended for where an op needs to store more data than a simple <code>op_sv</code> or whatever. Currently the only op of this type is <code>OP_MULTIDEREF</code> (see next item).</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new op has been added, <code>OP_MULTIDEREF</code>, which performs one or more nested array and hash lookups where the key is a constant or simple variable. For example the expression <code>$a[0]{$k}[$i]</code>, which previously involved ten <code>rv2Xv</code>, <code>Xelem</code>, <code>gvsv</code> and <code>const</code> ops is now performed by a single <code>multideref</code> op. It can also handle <code>local</code>, <code>exists</code> and <code>delete</code>. A non-simple index expression, such as <code>[$i+1]</code> is still done using <code>aelem</code>/<code>helem</code>, and single-level array lookup with a small constant index is still done using <code>aelemfast</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><code>close</code> now sets <code>$!</code></p>

<p>When an I/O error occurs, the fact that there has been an error is recorded in the handle. <code>close</code> returns false for such a handle. Previously, the value of <code>$!</code> would be untouched by <code>close</code>, so the common convention of writing <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>close $fh or die $!</code></span> did not work reliably. Now the handle records the value of <code>$!</code>, too, and <code>close</code> restores it.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>no re</code> now can turn off everything that <code>use re</code> enables</p>

<p>Previously, running <code>no re</code> would turn off only a few things. Now it can turn off all the enabled things. For example, the only way to stop debugging, once enabled, was to exit the enclosing block; that is now fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>pack(&quot;D&quot;, $x)</code> and <code>pack(&quot;F&quot;, $x)</code> now zero the padding on x86 long double builds. Under some build options on GCC 4.8 and later, they used to either overwrite the zero-initialized padding, or bypass the initialized buffer entirely. This caused <i>op/pack.t</i> to fail. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123971">[perl #123971]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Extending an array cloned from a parent thread could result in &quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot; errors when attempting to modify the new elements. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124127">[perl #124127]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>An assertion failure and subsequent crash with <code>*x=&lt;y&gt;</code> has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123790">[perl #123790]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>A possible crashing/looping bug related to compiling lexical subs has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124099">[perl #124099]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>UTF-8 now works correctly in function names, in unquoted HERE-document terminators, and in variable names used as array indexes. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124113">[perl #124113]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Repeated global pattern matches in scalar context on large tainted strings were exponentially slow depending on the current match position in the string. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123202">[perl #123202]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Various crashes due to the parser getting confused by syntax errors have been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123801">[perl #123801]</a> <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123802">[perl #123802]</a> <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123955">[perl #123955]</a> <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123995">[perl #123995]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>split</code> in the scope of lexical <code>$_</code> has been fixed not to fail assertions. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123763">[perl #123763]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>my $x : attr</code> syntax inside various list operators no longer fails assertions. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123817">[perl #123817]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>An <code>@</code> sign in quotes followed by a non-ASCII digit (which is not a valid identifier) would cause the parser to crash, instead of simply trying the <code>@</code> as literal. This has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123963">[perl #123963]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>*bar::=*foo::=*glob_with_hash</code> has been crashing since Perl 5.14, but no longer does. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123847">[perl #123847]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><code>foreach</code> in scalar context was not pushing an item on to the stack, resulting in bugs. (<span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>print 4, scalar do { foreach(@x){} } + 1</code></span> would print 5.) It has been fixed to return <code>undef</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124004">[perl #124004]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Several cases of data used to store environment variable contents in core C code being potentially overwritten before being used have been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123748">[perl #123748]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Some patterns starting with <code>/.*..../</code> matched against long strings have been slow since v5.8, and some of the form <code>/.*..../i</code> have been slow since v5.18. They are now all fast again. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123743">[perl #123743]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The original visible value of <code>$/</code> is now preserved when it is set to an invalid value. Previously if you set <code>$/</code> to a reference to an array, for example, perl would produce a runtime error and not set <code>PL_rs</code>, but Perl code that checked <code>$/</code> would see the array reference. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123218">[perl #123218]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In a regular expression pattern, a POSIX class, like <code>[:ascii:]</code>, must be inside a bracketed character class, like <code>qr/[[:ascii:]]/</code>. A warning is issued when something looking like a POSIX class is not inside a bracketed class. That warning wasn&#39;t getting generated when the POSIX class was negated: <code>[:^ascii:]</code>. This is now fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl 5.14.0 introduced a bug whereby <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>eval { LABEL: }</code></span> would crash. This has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123652">[perl #123652]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Various crashes due to the parser getting confused by syntax errors have been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123617">[perl #123617]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737">[perl #123737]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123753">[perl #123753]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123677">[perl #123677]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Code like <code>/$a[/</code> used to read the next line of input and treat it as though it came immediately after the opening bracket. Some invalid code consequently would parse and run, but some code caused crashes, so this is now disallowed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123712">[perl #123712]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix argument underflow for <code>pack</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123874">[perl #123874]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix handling of non-strict <code>\x{}</code>. Now <code>\x{}</code> is equivalent to <code>\x{0}</code> instead of faulting.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>stat -t</code> is now no longer treated as stackable, just like <code>-t stat</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123816">[perl #123816]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The following no longer causes a SEGV: <code>qr{x+(y(?0))*}</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed infinite loop in parsing backrefs in regexp patterns.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Several minor bug fixes in behavior of Infinity and NaN, including warnings when stringifying Infinity-like or NaN-like strings. For example, &quot;NaNcy&quot; doesn&#39;t numify to NaN anymore.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and other crashes has been fixed. This occurred only in patterns compiled with <code>/i</code> while taking into account the current POSIX locale (which usually means they have to be compiled within the scope of <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use locale</span></code>), and there must be a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123539">[perl #123539]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>s///g</code> now works on very long strings (where there are more than 2 billion iterations) instead of dying with &#39;Substitution loop&#39;. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=103260">[perl #103260]</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123071">[perl #123071]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>gmtime</code> no longer crashes with not-a-number values. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123495">[perl #123495]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>\()</code> (a reference to an empty list), and <code>y///</code> with lexical <code>$_</code> in scope, could both do a bad write past the end of the stack. They have both been fixed to extend the stack first.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>prototype()</code> with no arguments used to read the previous item on the stack, so <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>print &quot;foo&quot;, prototype()</code></span> would print foo&#39;s prototype. It has been fixed to infer <code>$_</code> instead. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123514">[perl #123514]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Some cases of lexical state subs declared inside predeclared subs could crash, for example when evalling a string including the name of an outer variable, but no longer do.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Some cases of nested lexical state subs inside anonymous subs could cause &#39;Bizarre copy&#39; errors or possibly even crashes.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When trying to emit warnings, perl&#39;s default debugger (<i>perl5db.pl</i>) was sometimes giving &#39;Undefined subroutine &amp;DB::db_warn called&#39; instead. This bug, which started to occur in Perl 5.18, has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123553">[perl #123553]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as <code>s/${&lt;&gt;{})//</code>, would crash, and had done so since Perl 5.10. (In some cases the crash did not start happening till 5.16.) The crash has, of course, been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123542">[perl #123542]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix a couple of string grow size calculation overflows; in particular, a repeat expression like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>33 x ~3</code></span> could cause a large buffer overflow since the new output buffer size was not correctly handled by <code>SvGROW()</code>. An expression like this now properly produces a memory wrap panic. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123554">[perl #123554]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>formline(&quot;@...&quot;, &quot;a&quot;);</code> would crash. The <code>FF_CHECKNL</code> case in <code>pp_formline()</code> didn&#39;t set the pointer used to mark the chop position, which led to the <code>FF_MORE</code> case crashing with a segmentation fault. This has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123538">[perl #123538]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A possible buffer overrun and crash when parsing a literal pattern during regular expression compilation has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123604">[perl #123604]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>fchmod()</code> and <code>futimes()</code> now set <code>$!</code> when they fail due to being passed a closed file handle. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122703">[perl #122703]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>op_free()</code> and <code>scalarvoid()</code> no longer crash due to a stack overflow when freeing a deeply recursive op tree. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108276">[perl #108276]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In Perl 5.20.0, <code>$^N</code> accidentally had the internal UTF-8 flag turned off if accessed from a code block within a regular expression, effectively UTF-8-encoding the value. This has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123135">[perl #123135]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A failed <code>semctl</code> call no longer overwrites existing items on the stack, which means that <code>(semctl(-1,0,0,0))[0]</code> no longer gives an &quot;uninitialized&quot; warning.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>else{foo()}</code> with no space before <code>foo</code> is now better at assigning the right line number to that statement. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122695">[perl #122695]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Sometimes the assignment in <code>@array = split</code> gets optimised so that <code>split</code> itself writes directly to the array. This caused a bug, preventing this assignment from being used in lvalue context. So <code>(@a=split//,&quot;foo&quot;)=bar()</code> was an error. (This bug probably goes back to Perl 3, when the optimisation was added.) It has now been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123057">[perl #123057]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When an argument list fails the checks specified by a subroutine signature (which is still an experimental feature), the resulting error messages now give the file and line number of the caller, not of the called subroutine. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121374">[perl #121374]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The flip-flop operators (<code>..</code> and <code>...</code> in scalar context) used to maintain a separate state for each recursion level (the number of times the enclosing sub was called recursively), contrary to the documentation. Now each closure has one internal state for each flip-flop. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122829">[perl #122829]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The flip-flop operator (<code>..</code> in scalar context) would return the same scalar each time, unless the containing subroutine was called recursively. Now it always returns a new scalar. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122829">[perl #122829]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>use</code>, <code>no</code>, statement labels, special blocks (<code>BEGIN</code>) and pod are now permitted as the first thing in a <code>map</code> or <code>grep</code> block, the block after <code>print</code> or <code>say</code> (or other functions) returning a handle, and within <code>${...}</code>, <code>@{...}</code>, etc. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122782">[perl #122782]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The repetition operator <code>x</code> now propagates lvalue context to its left-hand argument when used in contexts like <code>foreach</code>. That allows <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>for(($#that_array)x2) { ... }</code></span> to work as expected if the loop modifies <code>$_</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>(...) x ...</code> in scalar context used to corrupt the stack if one operand was an object with &quot;x&quot; overloading, causing erratic behavior. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121827">[perl #121827]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Assignment to a lexical scalar is often optimised away; for example in <code>my $x; $x = $y + $z</code>, the assign operator is optimised away and the add operator writes its result directly to <code>$x</code>. Various bugs related to this optimisation have been fixed. Certain operators on the right-hand side would sometimes fail to assign the value at all or assign the wrong value, or would call STORE twice or not at all on tied variables. The operators affected were <code>$foo++</code>, <code>$foo--</code>, and <code>-$foo</code> under <code>use integer</code>, <code>chomp</code>, <code>chr</code> and <code>setpgrp</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>List assignments were sometimes buggy if the same scalar ended up on both sides of the assignment due to use of <code>tied</code>, <code>values</code> or <code>each</code>. The result would be the wrong value getting assigned.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>setpgrp($nonzero)</code> (with one argument) was accidentally changed in 5.16 to mean <code>setpgrp(0)</code>. This has been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>__SUB__</code> could return the wrong value or even corrupt memory under the debugger (the <code>-d</code> switch) and in subs containing <code>eval $string</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>sub () { $var }</code></span> becomes inlinable, it now returns a different scalar each time, just as a non-inlinable sub would, though Perl still optimises the copy away in cases where it would make no observable difference.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>my sub f () { $var }</code></span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>sub () : attr { $var }</code></span> are no longer eligible for inlining. The former would crash; the latter would just throw the attributes away. An exception is made for the little-known <code>:method</code> attribute, which does nothing much.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Inlining of subs with an empty prototype is now more consistent than before. Previously, a sub with multiple statements, of which all but the last were optimised away, would be inlinable only if it were an anonymous sub containing a string <code>eval</code> or <code>state</code> declaration or closing over an outer lexical variable (or any anonymous sub under the debugger). Now any sub that gets folded to a single constant after statements have been optimised away is eligible for inlining. This applies to things like <code>sub () { jabber() if DEBUG; 42 }</code>.</p>

<p>Some subroutines with an explicit <code>return</code> were being made inlinable, contrary to the documentation, Now <code>return</code> always prevents inlining.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On some systems, such as VMS, <code>crypt</code> can return a non-ASCII string. If a scalar assigned to had contained a UTF-8 string previously, then <code>crypt</code> would not turn off the UTF-8 flag, thus corrupting the return value. This would happen with <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>$lexical = crypt ...</code></span>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>crypt</code> no longer calls <code>FETCH</code> twice on a tied first argument.</p>

</li>
<li><p>An unterminated here-doc on the last line of a quote-like operator (<code>qq[${ &lt;&lt;END }]</code>, <code>/(?{ &lt;&lt;END })/</code>) no longer causes a double free. It started doing so in 5.18.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>index()</code> and <code>rindex()</code> no longer crash when used on strings over 2GB in size. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121562">[perl #121562]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A small, previously intentional, memory leak in <code>PERL_SYS_INIT</code>/<code>PERL_SYS_INIT3</code> on Win32 builds was fixed. This might affect embedders who repeatedly create and destroy perl engines within the same process.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>POSIX::localeconv()</code> now returns the data for the program&#39;s underlying locale even when called from outside the scope of <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use locale</code></span>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>POSIX::localeconv()</code> now works properly on platforms which don&#39;t have <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> and/or <code>LC_MONETARY</code>, or for which Perl has been compiled to disregard either or both of these locale categories. In such circumstances, there are now no entries for the corresponding values in the hash returned by <code>localeconv()</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>POSIX::localeconv()</code> now marks appropriately the values it returns as UTF-8 or not. Previously they were always returned as bytes, even if they were supposed to be encoded as UTF-8.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On Microsoft Windows, within the scope of <code><span style="white-space: nowrap;">use locale</span></code>, the following POSIX character classes gave results for many locales that did not conform to the POSIX standard: <code>[[:alnum:]]</code>, <code>[[:alpha:]]</code>, <code>[[:blank:]]</code>, <code>[[:digit:]]</code>, <code>[[:graph:]]</code>, <code>[[:lower:]]</code>, <code>[[:print:]]</code>, <code>[[:punct:]]</code>, <code>[[:upper:]]</code>, <code>[[:word:]]</code>, and <code>[[:xdigit:]]</code>. This was because the underlying Microsoft implementation does not follow the standard. Perl now takes special precautions to correct for this.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Many issues have been detected by <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> and fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>system()</code> and friends should now work properly on more Android builds.</p>

<p>Due to an oversight, the value specified through <code>-Dtargetsh</code> to <i>Configure</i> would end up being ignored by some of the build process. This caused perls cross-compiled for Android to end up with defective versions of <code>system()</code>, <code>exec()</code> and backticks: the commands would end up looking for <code>/bin/sh</code> instead of <code>/system/bin/sh</code>, and so would fail for the vast majority of devices, leaving <code>$!</code> as <code>ENOENT</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>qr(...\(...\)...)</code>, <code>qr[...\[...\]...]</code>, and <code>qr{...\{...\}...}</code> now work. Previously it was impossible to escape these three left-characters with a backslash within a regular expression pattern where otherwise they would be considered metacharacters, and the pattern opening delimiter was the character, and the closing delimiter was its mirror character.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>s///e</code> on tainted UTF-8 strings corrupted <code>pos()</code>. This bug, introduced in 5.20, is now fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122148">[perl #122148]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A non-word boundary in a regular expression (<code>\B</code>) did not always match the end of the string; in particular <code>q{} =~ /\B/</code> did not match. This bug, introduced in perl 5.14, is now fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122090">[perl #122090]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>&quot; P&quot; =~ /(?=.*P)P/</code> should match, but did not. This is now fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122171">[perl #122171]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Failing to compile <code>use Foo</code> in an <code>eval</code> could leave a spurious <code>BEGIN</code> subroutine definition, which would produce a &quot;Subroutine BEGIN redefined&quot; warning on the next use of <code>use</code>, or other <code>BEGIN</code> block. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122107">[perl #122107]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>method { BLOCK } ARGS</code> syntax now correctly parses the arguments if they begin with an opening brace. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46947">[perl #46947]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>External libraries and Perl may have different ideas of what the locale is. This is problematic when parsing version strings if the locale&#39;s numeric separator has been changed. Version parsing has been patched to ensure it handles the locales correctly. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121930">[perl #121930]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A bug has been fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks inside of a regex could cause <code>pos</code> to see an incorrect value. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460">[perl #122460]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Dereferencing of constants now works correctly for typeglob constants. Previously the glob was stringified and its name looked up. Now the glob itself is used. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69456">[perl #69456]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>When parsing a sigil (<code>$</code> <code>@</code> <code>%</code> <code>&amp;)</code> followed by braces, the parser no longer tries to guess whether it is a block or a hash constructor (causing a syntax error when it guesses the latter), since it can only be a block.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>undef $reference</code></span> now frees the referent immediately, instead of hanging on to it until the next statement. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122556">[perl #122556]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Various cases where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading, error messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Bareword lookup now tries to avoid vivifying packages if it turns out the bareword is not going to be a subroutine name.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Compilation of anonymous constants (<i>e.g.</i>, <code>sub () { 3 }</code>) no longer deletes any subroutine named <code>__ANON__</code> in the current package. Not only was <code>*__ANON__{CODE}</code> cleared, but there was a memory leak, too. This bug goes back to Perl 5.8.0.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Stub declarations like <code>sub f;</code> and <code>sub f ();</code> no longer wipe out constants of the same name declared by <code>use constant</code>. This bug was introduced in Perl 5.10.0.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>qr/[\N{named sequence}]/</code> now works properly in many instances.</p>

<p>Some names known to <code>\N{...}</code> refer to a sequence of multiple characters, instead of the usual single character. Bracketed character classes generally only match single characters, but now special handling has been added so that they can match named sequences, but not if the class is inverted or the sequence is specified as the beginning or end of a range. In these cases, the only behavior change from before is a slight rewording of the fatal error message given when this class is part of a <code>?[...])</code> construct. When the <code>[...]</code> stands alone, the same non-fatal warning as before is raised, and only the first character in the sequence is used, again just as before.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Tainted constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause unrelated statements to become tainted. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122669">[perl #122669]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>open $$fh, ...</code></span>, which vivifies a handle with a name like <code>&quot;main::_GEN_0&quot;</code>, was not giving the handle the right reference count, so a double free could happen.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When deciding that a bareword was a method name, the parser would get confused if an <code>our</code> sub with the same name existed, and look up the method in the package of the <code>our</code> sub, instead of the package of the invocant.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The parser no longer gets confused by <code>\U=</code> within a double-quoted string. It used to produce a syntax error, but now compiles it correctly. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=80368">[perl #80368]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>It has always been the intention for the <code>-B</code> and <code>-T</code> file test operators to treat UTF-8 encoded files as text. (<a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlfunc.html#X-FILEHANDLE">perlfunc</a> has been updated to say this.) Previously, it was possible for some files to be considered UTF-8 that actually weren&#39;t valid UTF-8. This is now fixed. The operators now work on EBCDIC platforms as well.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Under some conditions warning messages raised during regular expression pattern compilation were being output more than once. This has now been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl 5.20.0 introduced a regression in which a UTF-8 encoded regular expression pattern that contains a single ASCII lowercase letter did not match its uppercase counterpart. That has been fixed in both 5.20.1 and 5.22.0. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122655">[perl #122655]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Constant folding could incorrectly suppress warnings if lexical warnings (<code>use warnings</code> or <code>no warnings</code>) were not in effect and <code>$^W</code> were false at compile time and true at run time.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Loading Unicode tables during a regular expression match could cause assertion failures under debugging builds if the previous match used the very same regular expression. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122747">[perl #122747]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Thread cloning used to work incorrectly for lexical subs, possibly causing crashes or double frees on exit.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Since Perl 5.14.0, deleting <code>$SomePackage::{__ANON__}</code> and then undefining an anonymous subroutine could corrupt things internally, resulting in <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/Devel/Peek.html">Devel::Peek</a> crashing or <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/B.html">B.pm</a> giving nonsensical data. This has been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>(caller $n)[3]</code></span> now reports names of lexical subs, instead of treating them as <code>&quot;(unknown)&quot;</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>sort subname LIST</code> now supports using a lexical sub as the comparison routine.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Aliasing (<i>e.g.</i>, via <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>*x = *y</code></span>) could confuse list assignments that mention the two names for the same variable on either side, causing wrong values to be assigned. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=15667">[perl #15667]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Long here-doc terminators could cause a bad read on short lines of input. This has been fixed. It is doubtful that any crash could have occurred. This bug goes back to when here-docs were introduced in Perl 3.000 twenty-five years ago.</p>

</li>
<li><p>An optimization in <code>split</code> to treat <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>split /^/</code></span> like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>split /^/m</code></span> had the unfortunate side-effect of also treating <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>split /\A/</code></span> like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>split /^/m</code></span>, which it should not. This has been fixed. (Note, however, that <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>split /^x/</code></span> does not behave like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>split /^x/m</code></span>, which is also considered to be a bug and will be fixed in a future version.) <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122761">[perl #122761]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>The little-known <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>my Class $var</code></span> syntax (see <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/fields.html">fields</a> and <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/attributes.html">attributes</a>) could get confused in the scope of <code>use utf8</code> if <code>Class</code> were a constant whose value contained Latin-1 characters.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Locking and unlocking values via <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/lib/Hash/Util.html">Hash::Util</a> or <code>Internals::SvREADONLY</code> no longer has any effect on values that were read-only to begin with. Previously, unlocking such values could result in crashes, hangs or other erratic behavior.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Some unterminated <code>(?(...)...)</code> constructs in regular expressions would either crash or give erroneous error messages. <code>/(?(1)/</code> is one such example.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>pack &quot;w&quot;, $tied</code></span> no longer calls FETCH twice.</p>

</li>
<li><p>List assignments like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>($x, $z) = (1, $y)</code></span> now work correctly if <code>$x</code> and <code>$y</code> have been aliased by <code>foreach</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Some patterns including code blocks with syntax errors, such as <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>/ (?{(^{})/</code></span>, would hang or fail assertions on debugging builds. Now they produce errors.</p>

</li>
<li><p>An assertion failure when parsing <code>sort</code> with debugging enabled has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122771">[perl #122771]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>*a = *b; @a = split //, $b[1]</code></span> could do a bad read and produce junk results.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>() = @array = split</code></span>, the <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>() =</code></span> at the beginning no longer confuses the optimizer into assuming a limit of 1.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fatal warnings no longer prevent the output of syntax errors. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122966">[perl #122966]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a NaN double-to-long-double conversion error on VMS. For quiet NaNs (and only on Itanium, not Alpha) negative infinity instead of NaN was produced.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed the issue that caused <code>make distclean</code> to incorrectly leave some files behind. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122820">[perl #122820]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>AIX now sets the length in <code>getsockopt</code> correctly. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120835">[perl #120835]</a>. <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183">[cpan #91183]</a>. <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570">[cpan #85570]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The optimization phase of a regexp compilation could run &quot;forever&quot; and exhaust all memory under certain circumstances; now fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122283">[perl #122283]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The test script <i>t/op/crypt.t</i> now uses the SHA-256 algorithm if the default one is disabled, rather than giving failures. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121591">[perl #121591]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed an off-by-one error when setting the size of a shared array. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122950">[perl #122950]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug that could cause perl to enter an infinite loop during compilation. In particular, a <code>while(1)</code> within a sublist, <i>e.g.</i></p>

<pre><code>    sub foo { () = ($a, my $b, ($c, do { while(1) {} })) }</code></pre>

<p>The bug was introduced in 5.20.0 <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122995">[perl #122995]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On Win32, if a variable was <code>local</code>-ized in a pseudo-process that later forked, restoring the original value in the child pseudo-process caused memory corruption and a crash in the child pseudo-process (and therefore the OS process). <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40565">[perl #40565]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calling <code>write</code> on a format with a <code>^**</code> field could produce a panic in <code>sv_chop()</code> if there were insufficient arguments or if the variable used to fill the field was empty. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123245">[perl #123245]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Non-ASCII lexical sub names now appear without trailing junk when they appear in error messages.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>\@</code> subroutine prototype no longer flattens parenthesized arrays (taking a reference to each element), but takes a reference to the array itself. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47363">[perl #47363]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A block containing nothing except a C-style <code>for</code> loop could corrupt the stack, causing lists outside the block to lose elements or have elements overwritten. This could happen with <code>map { for(...){...} } ...</code> and with lists containing <code>do { for(...){...} }</code>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123286">[perl #123286]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>scalar()</code> now propagates lvalue context, so that <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>for(scalar($#foo)) { ... }</code></span> can modify <code>$#foo</code> through <code>$_</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>qr/@array(?{block})/</code> no longer dies with &quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot;. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123344">[perl #123344]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>eval &#39;$variable&#39;</code></span> in nested named subroutines would sometimes look up a global variable even with a lexical variable in scope.</p>

</li>
<li><p>In perl 5.20.0, <code>sort CORE::fake</code> where &#39;fake&#39; is anything other than a keyword, started chopping off the last 6 characters and treating the result as a sort sub name. The previous behavior of treating <code>CORE::fake</code> as a sort sub name has been restored. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123410">[perl #123410]</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Outside of <code>use utf8</code>, a single-character Latin-1 lexical variable is disallowed. The error message for it, &quot;Can&#39;t use global <code>$foo</code>...&quot;, was giving garbage instead of the variable name.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>readline</code> on a nonexistent handle was causing <code>${^LAST_FH}</code> to produce a reference to an undefined scalar (or fail an assertion). Now <code>${^LAST_FH}</code> ends up undefined.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>(...) x ...</code> in void context now applies scalar context to the left-hand argument, instead of the context the current sub was called in. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123020">[perl #123020]</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Known-Problems">Known Problems</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><code>pack</code>-ing a NaN on a perl compiled with Visual C 6 does not behave properly, leading to a test failure in <i>t/op/infnan.t</i>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125203">[perl 125203]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>A goal is for Perl to be able to be recompiled to work reasonably well on any Unicode version. In Perl 5.22, though, the earliest such version is Unicode 5.1 (current is 7.0).</p>

</li>
<li><p>EBCDIC platforms</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>cmp</code> (and hence <code>sort</code>) operators do not necessarily give the correct results when both operands are UTF-EBCDIC encoded strings and there is a mixture of ASCII and/or control characters, along with other characters.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Ranges containing <code>\N{...}</code> in the <code>tr///</code> (and <code>y///</code>) transliteration operators are treated differently than the equivalent ranges in regular expression patterns. They should, but don&#39;t, cause the values in the ranges to all be treated as Unicode code points, and not native ones. (<a href="file:/c|/perl/html/pod/perlre.html#Version-8-Regular-Expressions">&quot;Version 8 Regular Expressions&quot; in perlre</a> gives details as to how it should work.)</p>

</li>
<li><p>Encode and encoding are mostly broken.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Many CPAN modules that are shipped with core show failing tests.</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>pack</code>/<code>unpack</code> with <code>&quot;U0&quot;</code> format may not work properly.</p>

<h1 id="Obituary">Obituary</h1>

<p>Brian McCauley died on May 8, 2015. He was a frequent poster to Usenet, Perl Monks, and other Perl forums, and made several CPAN contributions under the nick NOBULL, including to the Perl FAQ. He attended almost every YAPC::Europe, and indeed, helped organise YAPC::Europe 2006 and the QA Hackathon 2009. His wit and his delight in intricate systems were particularly apparent in his love of board games; many Perl mongers will have fond memories of playing Fluxx and other games with Brian. He will be missed.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <a href="file:/c|/perl/html/utils/perlbug.html">perlbug</a> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
